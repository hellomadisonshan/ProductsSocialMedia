Logistics is fast. Things should be fine
"Not bad, logistics is also very fast"
I didn’t receive the item. How come the delivery was completed? I called customer service and no one answered. It’s all your fault. What the hell?
"It's pretty good. I haven't found any problems after using it for a while. The sound quality is good, but it can't wake up the screen, which is a bit troublesome."
I have always used Huawei products. This is my first time buying a tablet. It is very easy to use and responds quickly! The screen is smaller than expected!
"It's a lie if they don't close during the Spring Festival. They won't deliver for seven days, so I have no choice but to go all the way to get it myself."
"Very good, very good value, the sound effect is very good, the price immediately increased by 178 after buying it, this routine,"
It's much larger than 5.5 inches. It's comfortable to watch TV series and the system runs smoothly.
Rubbish! Rubbish! Rubbish! It is not brand new. There are obvious insertion marks on the interface. It is not a first-hand product!
"The performance is great, highly recommended. My family likes it very much and will buy it again."
"Jingdong’s after-sales service is absolutely rubbish! ! ! No one answers the phone, please consider buying again! ! !"
"The charger is useless and the others are useless. I’m sure the charging head is useless. The new one is just like this. I can watch movies and play online games on the phone, but the charger is useless."
The logistics are great. My children like this product very much. It runs fast and the sound quality is very good. Worth shopping.
"For this price, the functions are okay for the elderly."
"There's something wrong with the speaker, I'm too lazy to replace it."
"My classmate bought this, it looks great! Good value for money! There have been no quality issues so far! Will evaluate later! What you need when buying JD.com’s self-operated products is the delivery speed."
"Unless Mengniu is blacklisted and bankrupt, foreign milk companies will not give up."
I like it very much. It's very beautiful. I started playing it as soon as I received it. It's awesome. I like it. I have two or three Huawei phones and they are all great! support! Huawei is made in China!
Experience by playing Honor of Kings fps19
"It's okay, but the leather case that came with it became useless after a few days of use, and it doesn't light up when I turn it on. The customer service asked me to go to the repair center for testing. Just pretend that there is no sensor leather case and just use it."
"Good, cost-effective, responsive, good sound quality, thumbs up"
"Needless to say, the battery of the mobile phone is too rubbish. When I first sold it, I had to send it back for verification, but now I don’t want to buy it."
"Less than a month later, it restarted with a blue screen and it is no longer usable."
Tell the truth! This phone is really bad! The screen always freezes when playing games! No response~~~It’s really hot
"It’s just that the resolution is a bit low, but everything else is fine."
good. . . . . .
"The WIFI and Bluetooth switches cannot be turned on, so I was sent a defective product. What a failure."
"Yes, it works fine. I gave it to my son for study. There is nothing wrong with it so far."
"Huawei is really good. After using more than 1,000 Huawei products, I will never change brands. The price/performance ratio would be perfect if it were higher."
"The tablet warranty is very good, JD.com is self-operated, so you can rest assured!"
The set meal was not sent but came with nothing. Very bad review.
Even Mengniu can’t boycott Japanese products.
It's very easy to use. This is my first time buying a Huawei tablet. The previous Xiaomi tablet had problems with its buttons. Dad is satisfied
"Very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good"
"To be honest, I have always bought things from JD.com before, and I trust them, but this time I was so disappointed. The price of the item was reduced as soon as I bought it*. I applied for price protection, but the direct reply was that it does not support it. . This is the first time I am so disappointed with JD.com."
"Not bad, shipping is fast. good quality"
This is rubbish Huawei. The price has been reduced less than a week after I bought it and I can’t apply for protection. I don’t want to give a bad review!
It’s not very good. The screen is uncomfortable to look at. The tablet manager still shows me to clean up the phone’s junk. I’m drunk. The packaging is also very crude. Don’t buy it.
Tell everyone about your experience of using it! Very sad usage experience! !
"No, nothing but the charger"
The 5.0 screen is too small compared to other phones. The phone is an eyesore and the functions sometimes don’t respond. I will never buy it again.
Jingdong’s interface is frustrating.
Can support memory card
I bought it for my colleague's mother and there are no problems so far.
"Very good, I like it very much, fast delivery"
Try using the tablet and experience it. It’s worth the price. It’s good value for money. It has a unique and thin appearance. It has an all-metal body design. It responds quickly and sensitively. There have been no problems for the time being. It’s easy to use and supports domestic production!
"A very cost-effective tablet, Huawei is a big brand and trustworthy!"
"The price is okay, the quality is okay, very good, she likes it very much"
"To be honest, screen smearing is very serious! Very very serious! ! Fortunately, I only use it to watch videos, and the video is acceptable. The color of the screen is very different from that of the computer."
"Too bad, the screen is so-so, the key is light leakage, the buttons have no flexibility at all, the speaker is a bit louder and the sound is broken, the price was reduced as soon as I bought it, the worst shopping experience on JD.com"
"There will be gifts as promised! As a result, I received the goods with nothing! Just a bare metal! I'm so disappointed"
"I sold it to my mother and said the resolution was a bit low. After checking it, it seemed that it was not high."
The charging socket broke after less than a month of use.
"It’s great and easy to use. My first Huawei phone, the Mate1, had a cracked screen, my second one, the X1, had a virus on the screen, my third one, the Honor 6, had a cracked screen, and my fourth one, the x2, can you guess the ending?"
"I saw that there were four gifts, but what I received was only a bare phone without a protective film. I contacted customer service and pushed back and forth, but they were told that all the gifts were gone. I called JD customer service four times but couldn't get through. Good for JD. disappointment."
"I feel so disgusted that I will never drink Mengniu milk again. If I want to drink it, I will drink Sanyuan milk! ! ! ! There are crawling insects in the sealed straws, and there are big bugs in the poured milk! ! ! Mengniu, why haven’t you closed down yet? ! ! ! !"
The customer service is so bad that they even hung up on me!
"Fortunately, I haven’t started using it yet."
"Very good. It's genuine. The logistics speed is very fast. The courier's attitude is very good. Bought for dad as a birthday present, he loves it. Jingdong’s after-sales service is also quite good, but the response to this online consultation is a bit slow, and I hope it can be improved."
"I bought a tablet for a colleague’s child. I haven’t seen it, but I heard from my colleague that the tablet is okay."
"The size of 8.4 inches seems large, but the actual width is the same as 7.0 inches. The length is too long. It is obvious that the length and width do not match. The defective products are the same. It is just deceptive marketing with the gimmick of large size."
I won’t buy it. Many friends and colleagues around me have stopped buying the Meng X brand for a long time. Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu
"The packaging is simple. The phone box is not plastic-sealed and has two pieces of tape. When I open the box, the phone does not have a plastic bag. There is a lot of dust on the screen. At first glance, it seems that the repair machine is slow to respond and stuck. The battery loses power quickly. I was deceived by JD.com."
Supporting domestic products is really not possible
"I don’t want to say anything about Mengniu’s new products, but I would like to send you my best wishes---good luck!"
"Overall, I am satisfied with the tablet. Even the protective case is not included. The express delivery service deserves 5 stars."
"Are you there? I have received the tablet. After using it for a few days, I discovered why it always freezes when I play mobile games. Sometimes it freezes 2 to three times every 10 minutes, and each time it freezes for about 3 seconds. What does this mean?"
#MengniuGoodmorning# I am the best! ! ! late ing~
"Can access the Internet, does not support calls, has good sound quality, smooth system, and is cost-effective. It is worth buying!"
"Good, economical, good quality and low price. Good goods are not expensive and worth buying. The workmanship is fine, the display is delicate, and the AnTuTu score is a little less than 80,000."
"It gets hot if left unused, so I need to return it."
The photo effect is very poor and not clear. . . . . . .
"The phone is good, the screen is big and clear, and the speed is fast."
I just want to say that it is wrong to cheat Mengniu. Selling drugs is a crime.
"Average, very average. Anyway, it’s the price. If you have high expectations, please be careful. I didn’t see the filled-in paper invoice."
"Children who participated in the ""Mengniu Consumer Experience Group"" visited Mengniu Meishan Factory in the morning, tasted Dongpo Pork Pork and other special Meishan dishes at noon, and visited the famous scenic spot Sansu Temple in the afternoon. The itinerary is very full"
"Mobile phones are average, the price is reduced within an hour of purchase, and the promotion is unreasonable. First negative review! ! !"
I will never buy Huawei again after I die.
"Very dissatisfied, bad review"
"Very good, the screen is clear and the operation is smooth. The price of JD 618 is quite good and it is worth buying."
"The quality is good. It’s a birthday gift for my son. The internet speed is fast, the screen is clear, and the design is reasonable. I like it very much."
MB? I won’t buy it in the future? Mengniu dare to say that it only harms the inland Chinese?
It’s so scary. Mengniu is awesome.
"The overall feeling is okay, but the battery drains quickly"
Bad review. Turn the volume to the maximum and you can’t hear clearly even if there is some noise in the room. It’s a bit of garbage.
"Bad, bad, bad. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
"When I placed the order, it said a leather case would be included. No result?"
"Cheap and good quality! Support domestic products! Support Huawei! Great company, hope to do better and better."
"The quality of the tablet is very good. No lag at all, very fast."
"The stuff is very rubbish, too unclear and there is no introduction. If I had known about it, I would have bought it from Apple."
The packaging is poor. There is not even a shock-proof air cushion inside such a tablet. There is just a bare product in the box.
I found that Mengniu Future Star tastes so good. Is this a mutation?
The pixels of the mobile phone are so poor that the photos taken are extremely blurry!
"Drinking unexpired yogurt can actually cause diarrhea... Mengniu, that's awesome"
"The heat dissipation is not good, it generates heat, and the battery is not durable. . . . depressed"
"It’s not bad, let’s see what the effect is first!"
"Yili is not good enough, so if you want to go to Mengniu, your humor will not die."
"Let’s make up the number. Let’s have some beans. I don’t know if there are any. Haha, it’s still not enough. Let’s do it again."
"Don’t mistake ignorance for selflessness. This display method is correct. Also, boycott Mengniu."
"The customer service said I could call the product the next day after I purchased it. However, when I got the product, they said it didn’t support SIM cards! Rubbish!"
"Don't go to this store to sell. They just sell things and only take orders, but don't provide services. In short, the service here is poor."
There’s nothing wrong with the phone! It’s just that Jingdong’s after-sales service is rubbish! It is recommended not to shop on JD.com!
The quality is a bit poor and not very easy to use.
I just used it for two days and I feel it’s okay. JD.com’s service is pretty good.
It feels good! Use it and see.
"The tablet is okay for use, but the resolution is not very high. It’s okay for reading e-books and videos."
"I bought six units at once and got three units. The order was placed yesterday and three units arrived today. The other three units are not available in Kunming and need to be transferred to Kunming. The appearance and configuration are just right, and it works great with a smart piano! Continue to support Huawei in the future"
"Yes, there were no major problems during use, but it seemed to be a little slow to respond."
"Just a week after buying it, the price is reduced and the promotion is on sale ~ you can get coupons ~ and you will get membership as a gift ~ scammer"
"The Ministry of Health needs to reflect on its milk powder policy. Without strict control, it not only harms consumers but also allows unscrupulous companies such as Mengniu to cause trouble. Endangering the next generation of our country."
Logistics is fast and the quality of the goods is very good.
"Good, runs smoothly, and expresses very well"
It's Mengniu again. I can no longer eat Mengniu. I won't buy any of Mengniu's products.
"The delivery is fast, the tablet responds quickly, and it also has eye protection function"
"Loyal users of Huawei, the quality is good, worth owning, five-star praise!"
Not bad
"I really regret it! I really know I was wrong! I shouldn’t have greedily eaten two Mengniu popsicles last night. As a result, I got a stomachache and diarrhea today! All kinds of discomfort! Wuwuwuwu, I will definitely have a long memory in the future! ! ! !"
"Bought this for my grandma, she loves it! ! ! First class"
I haven’t drank Mengniu for many years~~
I emphasize again: JD.com’s price protection is fake! There is never any notice for products that will be reduced in price!
I wonder if anyone is as confused as me between M3 and M3 Youth Edition?
"The price was reduced the day after I bought it, and I can’t apply for price protection. It’s such a scam. I've been using the tablet for a few days and it's working fine."
"The delivery was too slow. It took 3 days to deliver, which was a delay! Huawei, haha..."
"Not bad, bought it for my son. I'm going to play with it when I get back and say it's very beautiful!"
"Satisfied, I bought it for my husband."
There is something wrong with the matching items. The 6 mobile phone is matched with the 6S case.
"Huawei mobile phones are too expensive. I bought them for others, but I don’t use them myself."
It must be a 15-year-old machine. The response is very slow and the sound quality is average.
"Very good, affordable, very useful"
Very easy to use and fast. Jingdong logistics is fast. praise?
Screensavers are expensive. Don't know why. It feels very different from Honor x1. There is not even an ordinary invoice. I doubt it's authentic.
I feel like the people at Mengniu are very cool.
Mengniu bagged milk in the school supermarket has also increased from RMB 50 to RMB 2.
"It's very useful. I'm buying it for the second time now. The screen of the mobile phone is big, I like it quite a lot."
"I bought it in order to support domestic products, but I was very disappointed after buying it. The screen was too unclear."
Why do I set the automatic screen lock to 5 minutes? But it only takes about ten seconds for it to automatically lock the screen? Give me an explanation?
"Bought at a special price, the quality of JD.com is trustworthy, and the quality of Huawei is also very good."
"Just received it, haven’t started using it yet, I’ll comment after using it for a while"
Mengniu has quality issues
"The tablet is good, the screen is big, I finally don’t have to endure the small screen anymore"
"The sound effect is one of the key points of the choice, and the battery life is good."
The charger is broken. I just bought it a month ago.
I want a paper invoice! ! ! ! Please customer service contact me!
"I also don’t understand. Mengniu poisons you every day, and you still buy Mengniu products every day. Do you want to commit suicide or do you have masochistic tendencies?"
"It was originally said that there was a tempered film and a mobile phone case, but in the end there was nothing. After we communicated with each other, I started to make excuses, which made me very angry..."
well enough! It’s okay to use!
"Rubbish, the price was reduced as soon as I bought it! Poor quality and slow Internet speed"
The mobile phone is genuine. I like it very much. I bought it for my wife. My friend also asked me to buy it on JD.com. It was a good purchase. The appearance is very beautiful
I'm very satisfied with it. I didn't know it clearly before buying it. I bought the wifi version and can't play it in places without wifi.
"Expensive Mengniu Laimu ice cream mooncakes, super delicious!"
I bought several for 1299 and it’s ok now it’s 1249
I really don’t want to complain about the express delivery. Let’s not talk about the bad packaging. They didn’t even put a piece of foam in the box. It was a bumpy ride all the way. I dared to throw something worth less than two thousand to the guard and leave.
"The item looks good, but I haven’t used it yet. I’ll review it after it’s been used well. Others bought it with molds and covers, but I didn’t buy any. Is the cover at the very least a gift? Very disappointed???"
It was a very good shopping. The speed with which I bought it made my colleague think it was good. I bought another one for my colleague.
"The quality is not very good, it is a bit stuck, and the feel is not very good. The score is also very low. This is how it feels to me, to be honest"
"I was originally torn between Apple and Huawei. I already have a lot of Apples at home, so I decided to buy Huawei and give it a try. I was not disappointed, I really like it??"
It's pretty good to use. There may be a few minor issues that won't affect use. It's pretty good.
Tablet feels good
very nice. The sound effects are awesome. Exquisite workmanship. Didn't find any big problems.
"The package was left directly at the front desk, and someone was notified by phone in advance. There are no free gifts in the box?!"
I’ve been using it for a long time before reviewing it. I bought it during an event and it’s worth it. The products are also very good. Huawei’s domestic products are good. JD.com is very trustworthy. It’s really good.
"I placed an order on the 17th and was told it would be delivered on the 19th. However, I didn’t receive the express delivery until a week later. Bad review."
Not very useful and doesn’t run fast enough
"The delivery is relatively fast, and it’s good to use. It’s my first time using Huawei, give it a try."
"The brand is the brand, the products are very good, I hope to keep up the good work!"
"The song of the cute emperor is so good, it is indeed Mengniu Sour Yoghurt."
"I have used it for several days before reviewing it. I mainly play King of Kings, and it feels good. I also use China Unicom card. I used Samsung s7e to keep jumping on the indoor network, but m3 is not stable."
"Wrong goods shipped. You sent me the normal version, which is irresponsible."
It's okay. The black borders are relatively large and the sound is loud. It's fine for watching videos. I don't feel stuck even if I don't play games.
"Very very good! A New Year's gift for my mom, she loves it!"
Australian Mengniu...delicious!
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it, so I can only give a bad review."
Sanmao said: You shouldn’t look at it. Some people always like to believe that free lunch milk is not Mengniu! So shameless! Fairy tale-like hostile forces.
"When I bought it, there was a saved mobile number on the phone. It might be second-hand."
Yili's milk tablets are not as delicious as Mengniu's
How do you watch TV and movies? What did I do?
"Things are very good, very safe, and the service is also very good"
"Heating is fast, yes!"
I bought 2 for my relatives and they all said they are very useful.
"The security guard of this phone is particularly bad. Other security software installed is also restrictive. Alas, I have no choice."
"Mengniu is very low-key now. If you don’t drink Mengniu, you won’t die. Lao Yuan, we have no choice!"
"Domestic brand, high quality and low price, prompt and fast delivery. The packaging is standardized and intact, and the customer service is patient and responsible."
"My wife will use it again. The battery is too weak and it runs out of power for most of the day, which means you made the wrong choice."
The quality of the tablet is good. I used it for almost two weeks before reviewing it. JD.com is trustworthy.
"A very meaningful event, thank you Mengniu haha, these pictures are so friendly~~"
"Very good, very satisfied"
"Mengniu is heartbroken. I didn’t buy Mengniu before, I don’t buy Mengniu now, and I won’t buy Mengniu in the future!"
"Less than half a month later, the screen was broken. It costs at least 600 to 700 yuan to change the screen on the phone. I cried."
Freshly made milk has developed like this after just one day! Boycott Mengniu! Boycott foreign companies!
It’s terrible. Mengniu is such fucking garbage. Why don’t you die?
I don’t know if Huawei’s logo is sold at the counter. It’s given as a gift. The color is okay.
"I have been using an Apple iPad and replaced it with a domestically produced Android. I’m not a fruit fan, so I’m not going to criticize you based on my experience. I hope it helps you."
Rubbish! Jingdong is garbage! It is strongly recommended that you do not buy on JD.com! ! ! ! !
The battery is not very durable and the mobile phone signal is average. It is not yet certain whether it is a problem with the mobile phone itself.
The battery is too weak...resolution is low
It’s over. I accidentally drank Mengniu’s yogurt. Will anything happen to me? . .
"I didn’t use the tablet after I received it on a business trip. Today, when I turned it on, the sound was louder and quieter."
"Bad review. There is no membrane in the box. As soon as I got it, I asked customer service but they didn't reply. The customer service the next day insisted that it was in the box. It's not a matter of film, it's a matter of integrity."
"The sound effect is good, the resolution is okay, and it is easier to use than the previous X2. However, the battery is not very durable and loses power quickly. It runs out of power after 4-5 hours of watching videos. In addition, the handset is placed upward, making it inconvenient to make calls. Headphones required."
"Neat appearance, sensitive touch screen, overall picture is good"
Mengniu Huanqing Guli milk has been received. Mom and dad like to drink it. Thank you very much @SecondChildhood for supporting the honest brand. I wish the editor a prosperous career and a good mood every day! Thanks!
"It's been almost a month, and no one cares about me even if I talk to customer service. Ask him a question and he won't reply. How about you give me a reply? Is it appropriate to not respond if there is a fever flashback?"
"I have bought 3 X2s. Except for one that broke, I am satisfied with the others. I have been using the new phones for a while and they are very good. I trust JD.com."
"I just bought it and haven't used it much before a big problem appeared. For no reason, a vertical line of light and shadow appeared in the middle. After resetting the tablet, it is still there and won't let me change it."
"Jingdong can only give bad reviews, Jingdong can only give bad reviews, Jingdong can only give bad reviews, Jingdong can only give bad reviews."
I just used it for a while and it felt pretty good. It’s pretty good at this price!
Mengniu? Yili? Or light?
"Good quality, clear screen, smooth system. Like it"
This time I failed to buy a Huawei mobile phone from JD.com. I wanted to support domestic mobile phones and I was very disappointed. The packaging was too simple.
"Bought for a friend, looks pretty good"
"I want to give a negative review. It said 100 off, but I didn’t enjoy it... I asked customer service, and the customer service was a bit shady. He said no, but within three days he was completely reduced, so I just gave up."
"Not satisfied, I didn’t see the gifts, they said they were good, but they were all lies."
"It's very good, but HDAPP is a bit missing. Everything else is very good."
My mother uses it. It’s good for watching TV series.
"Needless to say, the screen is 2k-359ppi, the display color is also good, and there is no smearing phenomenon mentioned on the Internet."
"The product is very good, Jingdong's quality control is reassuring, the after-sales service is guaranteed, genuine products are supported, and domestic products are supported!"
The worst battery can't even last a day on standby. Bad battery. Bad battery.
"I have long wanted to use Huawei. This time I bought it and tried it. It is good and smooth enough. If you are concerned about the black edges, I suggest you buy it with caution. After all, the cost of being bezel-less is too high. The price is good value for money."
I bought it for an elderly person. I haven’t seen the actual product. I trust JD.com and I’m used to good reviews!
Always use Huawei electronic products
"Mengniu is also very good,,, tastes good,"
"It looks good, you get what you pay for, but the pixels are poor."
"It's so rubbish. After using it for a few months, it became useless!"
I bought two. This one looks like a refurbished phone. The label has been tampered with and the phone in the box has not been put into the protective case.
"Sometimes it automatically shuts down and restarts, and I can’t detect the cause. It’s so frustrating."
"I have been using it for more than a month. This is the second one. The screen has high definition, the photos are colorful, and the Internet speed is also good. I am very satisfied!!"
"Overall it's OK, the workmanship is fine, but the backlight is uneven, the bottom is more obvious, and the 8 million pixels are a bit low."
"After using it for 20 days, the phone often automatically locks the screen, which is very annoying. The most unacceptable thing is that sometimes there is no carriage return mark and three main menu images at the bottom. I have to restart the phone to solve the problem. I want to return it, but I don’t know if I can exchange it for a new one. The software requires Keep up"
"Watching videos is sometimes in black and white, and the basic functions are so poor."
I just bought it and the price was reduced for a flash sale. Not happy………
I bought the second one as a tablet for the elderly. Like it very much
"Given as a gift, the price-performance ratio is good, but the performance is average in all aspects, and the photography and capacity are too tight."
"I use a Huawei phone, so this is very easy to use. It was my first time shopping on JD.com, and I felt a little stingy, not even applying a protective film. Logistics is very fast."
"I couldn’t even log in with a Huawei account, and it didn’t even have the initial film when it was delivered. Others bought leather cases from the same store, but mine had nothing. Bad review."
"I am very dissatisfied. I have bought so many times on JD.com, but this time I missed the gift. At first, I insisted not to open the box for inspection, and had to contact customer service to verify."
The express delivery was very fast and arrived in one day.
"I bought this because of the Huawei brand, I hope it lasts a long time."
"What I hate the most is the senior officials of Mengniu, who have no sense of serving the people. Such a national enterprise should not just forward Mengniu's milk to the whole people! ! ! :You are so ""strong""! Reject Mengniu series products from now on!"
"Despise Mengniu, despise COFCO, despise Ning Gaoning"
"The items have been received, the delivery guy’s service is excellent."
"The most rubbish tablet, the screen often freezes, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish"
"Can't turn it on, I'm so hesitant! I want to apply for after-sales service!"
"I generally don't leave negative reviews. I'm the first one to come here. JD.com's customer service is so perfunctory and their attitude is so bad. Say whatever you want, you can return it as you like. I'm not sending it to you."
"This is my first time to buy an Android system product. I consulted a lot of opinions and finally made the decision. Overall, it’s pretty good."
"Classic Mengniu, the taste is always the same! It's not that I don't want to talk, but there are a lot of things I can't say, so I feel safer if I keep them in mind."
It feels very bad and not skin-friendly.
The products and services are good. I will buy them again in Kyoto next time.
I just bought it and it was reduced by 200. Not happy.
Will review next
Can
Very good and affordable! The brand is trustworthy!
The phone cannot be charged. It has not been used for a day. I don’t know if it is refurbished.
"Charging is super slow. I can’t keep up with charging while watching. It’s bad, bad, bad."
"Problems arise one after another... But I no longer eat Mengniu products. If I do, I have to eat Yili products."
"The product was so bad that it broke just a month after I bought it. When I took it to be sent for repair, it was told that the motherboard would need to be replaced. I was speechless."
"Could it be worse? The screen is broken the next day after coming back? Followed by crash, crash, crash, flashing still doesn’t work, rubbish, one star is for express delivery"
"The standby time is long, the photos are better than my Xiaomi Mi 4, and the size is just right. If it is bigger, I would find it inconvenient."
"Very useful, thumbs up. . . :)"
"I bought this for a friend and I don’t know if it’s good or not, so I’ll give it five points."
"The price drops as soon as you buy it, and you don’t get anything as a gift."
"Bought for my parents, suitable size, easy to carry, affordable price"
"Just two months after I bought it, the speaker of my phone broke. This is my first time buying Huawei. People say that Huawei is of good quality. So disappointed."
Huawei products are trustworthy and of good quality. I have purchased them many times and support domestic products. I will buy them again if necessary.
"Boycott Mengniu, start with me! ! ! Whoever drinks Mengniu is dumb and speechless."
It’s just a rubbish mobile phone. Jingdong is just selling junk products. It broke within a month. You have to go and test it yourself. It’s a bad review. It’s a very bad review with zero points!
Very good. I trust it to be made in China. I have bought several of them.
Nice big brand! Trustworthy JD.com fast delivery
"Speechless! ! ! It took 8 days for a regular courier to send it to me! 8 OMG! If you didn’t buy it on Double Eleven, couldn’t you choose a faster courier company?"
Should we boycott Japanese products or Mengniu? I'm undecided...
I placed an order yesterday and the price dropped today. Can I buy a new one? Jingdong is also invincible now. Let’s not talk about anything else. One point for the courier.
"Bought for children to study, it is very fast, the memory can be expanded, and it is easy to carry when going out!"
The price will be reduced after buying the negative reviews! I have to stare at it every time I buy something from JD.com! Has the price been reduced?
"The mobile phone is okay, but the express delivery is very unsatisfactory"
Bought at a reduced price. . . . Bought for the elderly to listen to the opera. The old man was very satisfied. It's just that the memory is small. The price is here.
My family reported that the battery was very weak. It shut down after two days of standby and charging was slow. My family asked me if I had bought a used phone.
Definitely not buying it! There is only one attitude toward Mengniu: don’t buy it.
"resist! ! ! I never drink Mengniu. Yes, yes, yes. Oil. It really touches my eyebrows. It’s bad luck. I must show off the tin foil during Qingming Festival."
I hope the recognition of Mengniu can be improved based on the health and safety of consumers!
"I gave it as a gift, I don’t know if it will be useful or not. Support Huawei, hope the system can be optimized with some snacks"
The delivery speed is amazing and the price is affordable.
"The goods have been received, very good, runs smoothly, and the screen is very good!"
Boycott Mengniu
"The milk powder I bought was actually opened, but the customer service said it had been signed for and could not be processed! ! ! ! I will not buy from your store after negative reviews. Bully me as an honest person"
"I don’t even want to talk about this. Why is it that when the phone is turned on, only 50% of the battery is left, and there are so many software running in the background? Tell me, why are there still some applications that are not native? I wonder if this is a different phone. . ."
"It is indeed better looking than expected, fast, good logistics, great value, much cheaper than physical stores!"
"The price of 999 is very good, but the screen needs to be improved. Too clear and detailed is not good enough."
There is something wrong with the data cable and it cannot be charged. I strongly doubt whether it is the original one from the factory!
"From now on, just don’t buy it. Mengniu’s public relations is so good, I’ve been infiltrated so many times."
I bought it for a colleague and I like it very much.
"After receiving the goods, I was a little disappointed with what I had seen before. Apart from an electrical appliance, nothing was given, not even a phone card."
Bad review. There is no headphone cable and no invoice. I am annoyed.
"After receiving the express delivery, there is no invoice and it cannot be delivered on time. The gifts advertised are not from Jingdong! You are so screwed, so just this time delete the APP decisively and never use it again."
Very thin and beautiful. The sound effect is good and the colors are good when watching movies. The whole family uses Huawei and they all feel very good. They support domestic products.
"I bought it at a discounted price, more than 1,470 yuan, which is a dollar more expensive than a smaller air conditioner, haha"
"I have been buying from JD.com, every time I buy it, it is good, at least it is authentic, good quality and low price, you deserve it"
I have just used it for a short time and bought it for children to study. It is enough!
"I bought this for my wife, I didn’t ask how it works."
"To be very objective, if there are buyers who are ready to buy this tablet, they should look at other products, such as Apple and Xiaomi. The LeTV membership promised was not fulfilled at all, with various excuses and reasons..."
"Bought for my parents, they are very satisfied, except for the touching black border, everything else is good"
"The machine is brand new, the speed is smooth, and the battery is good. I played games for 2 hours and the battery was used up by 20%. Support Huawei, support JD.com!"
"Very good machine, I like it"
The one-star price reduction right after I bought it was for the courier guy.
I have been using it for a long time and play Honor of Kings every day. Hahaha
"It hasn't even been a week, but the plastic block at the bottom has become loose. The workmanship is poor."
This is my first time using Huawei products and I feel they are not as easy to use as ASUS tablets.
Rubbish. I bought this for my dad. It’s only been a month and my dad said he can’t turn it on.
Spread speed! Mengniu is more cheating than cutting cakes! ~oyeah!
I will never drink Mengniu again.
"The overall machine is very capable of sending messages by hand. If the characters are incomplete, the frequency will jump."
"I just bought it less than a month ago and the price was lowered*. I thought JD.com was better, but I didn’t expect that they would adjust the price randomly like*. I’m really speechless!"
I received the baby and tried it. The effect is pretty good. I like it very much.
"Just to show off, I can’t say anything about the delivery speed, but haha,,,,,,,,, it crashed three times, it arrived yesterday,,,,,,, other buyers can figure it out by themselves."
"If you don’t drink Mengniu, you don’t drink Yili, you drink Trensu, this high-end stuff like Rourou! Damn you!"
"In less than half a month, it dropped by 200! How embarrassing!"
The invoice was delayed and the after-sales response was too slow.
Very good. No problems found for now. I like it very much.
Screen clarity sucks
"The outer box was soaked by the rain. The goods ordered on the 15th were not delivered until the 21st. The goods ordered later arrived earlier. It is still self-operated. This is the first time I have encountered this situation. If you haven’t stocked up on things yet, let’s evaluate them first."
A little error
"Mengniu Xianyu milk tea is a new product on the market, pure milk source paired with authentic black tea, no creamer added @Mengniu Dairy"
The overall feeling is satisfactory. I checked that it is genuine. It is fine for playing games. The pixels are average. It can also be used in standby mode.
Haha ~ I don’t drink Mengniu! So scary @messyvinal
"The screen is smaller than expected and the resolution is average. However, the WIFI version is fast to access the Internet."
TEM8! I borrowed a lot of Zhuanba books~ I was moved by my sudden eagerness to learn~ ps Mengniu’s distingue* milk tablets are delicious!
I have supported Mengniu! @ Tangtangtang_??
I received the tablet. The screen is big but the resolution is a bit low. Overall it’s pretty good. I bought it for my nephew to play King of Kings.
"I gave it to my brother. I don’t know what it looks like or whether it’s good, but he said it’s okay. I’ll comment after using it. There’s nothing to say about JD Logistics, it’s just fast!"
"A very cost-effective product, I have been using Huawei"
"If I'm not satisfied, I want to return it and exchange it for another one."
The tablet is very smooth. It is my second Huawei tablet. The price is okay and the quality should be excellent among domestic manufacturers.
"Not only do I like banana milk, but I also like banana crispy ice cream, both from Mengniu."
"I received the tablet. There is a little paint peeling off the upper right corner border. I don’t know how to fix it! Also, the tablet looks particularly unclassy!"
Guangming has long been unable to drink! I never buy Guangming and Mengniu
It’s great. Huawei really puts their heart into it and the sound effects are great!
"It's okay, the sound quality is good, but the video can only be viewed in ultra-high definition, which is not ideal."
"The screen is unresponsive, I suspect it is a repaired product."
"It’s a very good tablet, Huawei is still good, and JD.com is also very trustworthy! The courier guy is very nice, give me a thumbs up!"
Just bought it and the price was reduced the next day! That's too much!
"OK, +1 if you don’t buy. +1 if you don’t buy Mengniu."
"I bought two gifts and only gave one. I also asked customer service, but they didn't respond. Nowadays, JD.com’s management of external merchants is getting worse and worse. Not only is the express delivery slow, but the service attitude is also bad. Please think twice before buying."
"Very good, delivery speed is very fast, and the attitude is also good"
"Haven't used it yet, don't know"
Not bad. . . . . . . . . . . .
"I didn’t receive what I bought, but the order prompted me that the transaction was completed. Why was it hacked? Don't make such a joke on me!"
The sound effect is ok and the dual speakers are ok.
"The attitude is very bad. When I received the goods, I found that the outer packaging was damaged. I asked to open the packaging for inspection, but the courier refused. This was a very unpleasant purchase. I don’t know if the product is good or not. I will comment later."
"The delivery speed of mobile phones is a bit slow, and the price dropped by 50 yuan every other day. The limited time price on JD.com is really unbelievable."
The price was reduced by 40 yuan the day after purchase. I was not happy.
The courier service attitude is not good. They delivered it without notifying me.
Mengniu is so evil. . . Mengniu fell again
"Mengniu: A glass of milk a day, raping Chinese people. This ad is so deceptive. Is the input method wrong? ?"
"There were no gifts promised when I bought it, and the after-sales attitude was so bad..."
"It’s a rubbish tablet, it’s so laggy when you play games!"
"Bought for a friend, very good, a good deal"
JD.com is becoming more and more disappointing. It only took 9 days to receive the goods. The application for price reduction * was not approved. I am very disappointed with JD.com.
"Exceeded my expectations, no worse than other fruits, the sound and picture quality are impeccable, great"
Trust your brand and evaluate after using it. Logistics is very fast!
"Mengniu has promised that the standards of dairy products supplied to Hong Kong are higher than those from the mainland, and there will be absolutely no problems. Hit the nail on the head!"
good
Corporate gifts should be great! ! ! !
Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu
"It's good, but the response is too slow."
"I have been paying attention to this tablet for a long time. It is great. I like it very much. If I use it well, I will recommend it to my friends."
"Too bad, liar, the pixels are too bad!"
"After using it for a while, the system is smooth to use and does not lag. The overall feeling is good?"
"Express delivery is not possible,,,"
"This model is very cost-effective and really good. The battery life is a bit poor, but it’s worth the price."
"The tablet configuration is good, but the processor is mediocre. Huawei software and system services can be rated zero points. There are basically no upgrade services. The system itself is a mess. This is my last time buying a Huawei tablet, maybe I can consider Huawei phones in the future."
"The machine is a bit laggy to use, it doesn't feel as described, the battery life is a bit poor, and the response is sometimes delayed."
Huawei Tablet M3 has a good display and fast fingerprint unlocking!
The wifi signal is really bad! ! ! !
The screen display is unclear and blurry
"The marked gifts were not given, and they were said to be for other activities. trap!"
Come to Mengniu Sour Yoghurt Music Chart~~~So close~~~Hahaha
Mengniu took the lead and set an example.
"Jingdong is fast, I used the coupon, it’s not bad! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"Meng milk, rape Chinese people. . . A cup of Mongolian milk every day rapes the Chinese people. I don’t drink Mengniu either. http:t.cn/SwVn7N"
"Well, this brand is very fast, ah, and the screen resolution is also good, ah, very satisfied."
"I like it very much. The voice is very clear when making phone calls, it is amazing to play games, and the Internet speed is very fast!"
The tablet is very easy to use. It’s just the right size and easy for children to hold. It’s also smooth to play King of Kings. I regret not having one that can make calls.
Very good and worth buying. Huawei products are great. Thanks also to JD.com.
"The speed is too slow. It took several days to send messages and call to urge the goods to arrive. The goods have just been used, so it’s just so-so."
"It's okay, it runs smoothly overall, and it's worth buying!"
"Very dissatisfied, stuck"
"After purchasing Huawei products, someone will take care of the after-sales service! Very spot on! Jingdong’s self-operated products are even better! Buy with confidence and use with confidence!"
"The product is easy to use, fast and not stuck. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Good reviews."
"I didn't want to leave a bad review, so I just placed the order and got a promotion and a free gift. I contacted customer service and found out that I loved the look. I returned it and took another photo!"
"Yili is a masterpiece, I won’t buy Mengniu anymore after Mengmeng! ! ! Another outrageous ad! ! So full of hobbies and love~Chinese advertising can be saved! It’s impossible to guess what kind of ad it is until you read it."
"The delivery is too bad, the machine is just like this, and the packaging is too wasteful!"
The new packaging of Mengniu pure milk is much more beautiful and simple...
"After paying for a few days, the product was not shipped or informed. Then I asked customer service and was told it was out of stock and had to wait. What are you selling if you don’t have anything? After I received the money, they said it was out of stock and asked me to wait until the 13th. Then I complained and it was shipped immediately. Jingdong is getting more and more rubbish!"
"Don’t play in summer, it will get hot to your hands’"
"After COFCO controls Mengniu, I may have a better impression of Mengniu."
"Not bad, good, very good"
"It's okay, the running speed is good, but the charging is too slow"
I believe that Huawei's products have been used with stable and good results!
"The stuff is good, I am very satisfied with it in every aspect and like it very much"
"Second-hand, the tablet I bought has been used. There is no packaging on the tablet, and there are some toilet paper-like debris inside the unopened box. The inside and outside of the box are dirty, and the charging port has scratches where the charger was inserted."
I am very dissatisfied. It broke just three days after I bought it...
The resolution is very poor. You can choose another model. I really regret it.
"It supports domestic products and the quality is pretty good. It’s a pity that the screen was smashed. Although it’s still usable, it hurts to look at it."
Why can't I make calls or connect when I put the card into this newly purchased mobile phone? Why can I just change to another mobile phone? why is that?
"Opening computer web pages is very slow, not recommended"
"It's used by my family, I haven't seen it, I heard it's good"
"The screen is larger than expected, feels good in the hand, and runs at a decent speed. The visual effect of the small movie and TV window on the desktop is not very good. It feels like a bit of an extension."
"Too bad, the screen was not working for a week, and after applying for a replacement, the logistics did not arrive for three days. What a cliché!"
"The mobile phone is fine, I’m using it now, it was 999 when I bought it, and my colleague bought it for more than 2,000 last year~~ The screen is big, and it’s more fun to watch videos, haha"
The tablet is good. I bought it for a friend and he also said it is good.
"Hey, the Chinese men’s basketball team is sponsored by Mengniu with its full family support."
I have been using it for a while before commenting. It is very good and worth buying. The quality is very good and practical.
"I bought it for my brother. When I received the goods, he told me that the logistics was really fast and the items were very good. It was what he wanted."
"The quality is nothing to say, and the delivery service is also great! I always buy it on JD.com, and it’s very affordable. I recommend it."
"I won’t talk about the performance of domestically produced machines. I don’t know how many times I have been tricked by Huawei. I was disconnected halfway through copying something. Big brands should not keep doing such tricks. If you can’t do it well, don’t try to trick the Chinese again. Alone"
"After ordering one and receiving it, the WIFI connection kept disconnecting. Later, after contacting customer service and getting a replacement, it still remained the same. I was powerless and too lazy to bother. It has been left untouched."
I received the tablet and have been using it for a while before reviewing it. The smoothness is very good and there are no screen freezes so far. The price/performance ratio of a tablet at this price is quite high.
"It’s just a huge Huawei, it’s easy to use"
I used to drink Mengniu all the time! Who is less afraid of death than me?
"I bought it for my mom, but the price dropped after I bought it, which makes me unhappy."
"Screen smearing, using a cheap negative LCD screen, Huawei is cutting corners and will go out of business sooner or later!"
I've been using the tablet for a few days and it's fine. Not stuck at all.
I bought it for someone else. It’s very bad to force a review.
Mengniu’s cows are said to be very smart. They will line up to bathe and milk themselves.
"Queuing up to go to work, how positive and loyal we are! Does it look like Mengniu?"
I will never buy Huawei again. I am heartbroken?!
"It's okay. Although the processor is 930, it is relatively smooth in actual use."
"The boot speed is slow, I hope Huawei can improve it further"
"The speaker sound effect is very good, and the screen display effect is also very good and smooth. I don’t play games, but I usually go online and watch videos. It’s worth the money."
I have been paying attention to it for a long time. I finally grabbed it when there was an event. The logistics was fast and it arrived the next day. I am very satisfied and have good reviews.
I bought it for an elderly person. It works well and my children can play smoothly.
Very good. It has been installed. The service is very good. The set of pieces and the water heater are shipped separately.
I won’t drink any Yilimeng beef from now on. Now I feel sick hearing it
"It runs very smoothly, and there is no lag when playing games. The price/performance ratio is good and worth owning. Highly recommended."
"I obviously chose the shell membrane set, why doesn’t it come with it? No one from customer service responded either."
Which brand of large fruit is more delicious? Mengniu Yili or Guangming
It's just one day past the price protection. It's all a routine.
"What a scam! If you can't do anything else, boycott Mengniu!"
"I have always trusted Midea, the products are very good. I really like the appearance and style. Heats up quickly."
A very bad shopping trip. The staff at the pick-up station made things difficult in every possible way and refused to open the box. They had a very bad attitude.
Rejected Mengniu for a long time
"You can't get it for 799 on the first day, you can buy it for 899 on the second day, and you can buy it for 799 on the third day. You belong to Monkey King."
I only bought it for more than half a month and the buttons failed. It's really annoying. It's rubbish. It takes 30 days to return it to the factory for repair. It's really rubbish.
"999 rush purchase, the current price is unbeatable, after receiving it, I found that the Fortune Edition comes with the original leather case! Very unexpected! It’s just that Jingdong’s packaging is too crude!"
There are no headphones. There is a card slot that cannot be used.
Mengniu yogurt flavored popsicles are the best!
"The battery life is not good, and there is also a problem with the screen. When playing Honor of Kings, the multi-touch control fails and I can’t release skills by pressing the direction. I usually review something after using it for a month."
"Bad review, not good enough"
"I don’t want to give it one star, but the problem of not having headphones really made me complain a lot. I’m also very helpless. And I saw that there are headphones in the comments with pictures. Why is there no headphones in the one I got?"
"There are too many advertisements, which make people lose patience with the program. What’s even more annoying is that there is Mengniu!"
"Okay, this is very cost-effective. You can insert a card, which is enough for watching videos and so on."
"Bought this for my dad. He said it's very good. It's better than the previous Samsung. It only costs 1,000 yuan and it's worth it."
Are Huawei products packaged like this? I don’t know if it’s true or not.
"I like it very much, great phone, support"
"Not good, many things cannot be used, JD.com is getting worse and worse"
"Good attitude, door-to-door delivery"
"I always buy electronic products from JD.com, it’s trustworthy!"
"I bought it to play King of Kings, it is very smooth and the sound quality is good! Watching movies and listening to music are both good choices!"
Already received. I bought the x1 last year and lost it this year. I bought this second generation.
"After unboxing, the battery was more than 50%. After playing for nearly four hours, 14% of the battery was left. It took three and a half hours to fully charge, which is a bit long."
"First-line big brand, good quality"
"3+32g, the speed is very good and the experience is very good"
"The sad baby milk, Future Star, Mengniu is not willing to admit that it is its own product, such a small Mengniu"
I think this new packaging is very good. This one from Daai Mengniu is much prettier than before.
"The screen is broken, so I bought it for nothing."
"It arrived quickly, JD.com’s logistics is indeed extraordinary! The quality of the tablet is also very good (???)"
"I ate Mengniu Ice Brick again. It was delicious. If I don’t eat it twice more, I won’t be able to eat it again when I get home."
Believe in the quality of beauty
Huawei's brand is trustworthy. It supports domestic products. I bought it for my nephew. It can be used as a learning machine. This model can also be used as a phone by inserting a SIM card from China Mobile or China Unicom. The price is affordable and awesome.
"To be honest, shopping is not very ideal. After I bought it, it crashed before I turned it on."
"Received the item, not bad"
Huawei x2 does not wake up with double click
Returns and exchanges on JD.com are too laborious! You still have to go to the mall to buy electronic products! The mall offers no reason to return or exchange goods within one month! And you can return or exchange the items immediately after you take them out.
The order I placed at 10:30 in the morning arrived at 4 pm. It was so fast. The video on the tablet was very clear and the photos were great. The price was worth it.
"I bought it at 1888, but if the price dropped the next day, they wouldn’t insure the price. They said it was a limited purchase and it didn’t count. This is my first bad review!"
I bought it but it’s still the same as before. It’s very easy to use and great. Ah.
I’ve made a lot of purchases on JD.com and I’ve almost never been disappointed. It’s pretty good. Keep up the good work.
The quality is not very good. Don't know what to say.
I bought it for the elderly at home. The screen size is large and it is very comfortable to watch videos. It is a good deal to buy it at a special price.
"The quality and price are good, a satisfying purchase"
"This is the second time I bought it and I am very satisfied with it, giving it 5 points."
The delivery is timely and the phone is very smooth to use. It would be better if there are headphones delivered.
"The quality is good, very good!"
What a big mistake.
"Although it is cruel, a company like Mengniu must let him go bankrupt."
The phase is too low and the speed is very slow
"It’s not easy to use. It’s stuck since I started using it. The response is slow. It’s been 7 days since I started using it. Otherwise, I’d have to return it decisively. It’s such a trap."
"When playing Honor of Kings, multi-touch cannot be used. Directions and skills cannot be pressed at the same time. After re-entering, it was fine. However, this problem occurred after only two games. I am not satisfied."
"Not bad, very good. I trust Jingdong’s self-operated products. The quality is guaranteed, the price is affordable and the delivery is fast."
Not so good! ! No invoices are given! I don’t know what to do after the sale!
Customer service talks like farts! The things I promised to send were rejected in every possible way!
It is used as a toy for little ones. The screen of the mobile phone is too small and the glasses are easy to break. This is better. It is not expensive and is worth owning.
Huawei (HUAWEI) Honor
"Fast logistics, good stuff, soft colors, comfortable to the eyes, very satisfied. Give five stars and watch again next time"
"The ordering speed was super fast. I placed the order on the first night and it arrived the next morning. I also like the thing very much, it is very thin and light, and the screen clarity is also very good. My mother likes it very much!"
"Very good, recommended by a colleague."
"Personally, I think Zhongren’s suit is not as good-looking as Mengniu’s that day. . . Please change my ideal hairstyle quickly~~~This kid was born in 1994~~~This hairstyle is to die for~~~"
"The first time I bought something from JD.com, it was really confusing. The customer service was very slow. The most important thing is why the negative reviews cannot be submitted?"
"Bad review, the resolution is too low and the response speed is average."
"Pretty good, good review"
The tablet is good. It’s very convenient to buy it for my mother to watch TV.
The difference between having a call and not having a call refers to the phone function. Other properties are the same.
Especially bad. Bad review
"Booting up is faster than xm, and the screen is clear whether watching movies or browsing."
JD.com/Huawei sell reconditioned machines as new! ! JD.com/Huawei sell reconditioned machines as new! ! JD.com/Huawei sell reconditioned machines as new! !
"JD.com is so awesome, and so is the courier guy. Thumbs up!"
You say Mengniu is not good and you keep buying their products at the same time. It’s strange that Mengniu cares about what you say. PS. I have already started boycotting Mengniu. It’s not unusual for this to happen to Mengniu.
"If you place an order yesterday and don't get a set or mold, you will get one today, which will cause you to spend more money on the mold. If you place an order yesterday and don't get a set or mold, you will get one today, which will cause you to spend more money on the mold."
"As a domestic dairy giant, Mengniu has truly played a leading and exemplary role."
"Very good, a great tool for children and the elderly to spend time"
"So-so, not clear enough"
"The overall feeling of using the tablet is pretty good, but the WIFI often automatically switches wireless networks, and I don’t know where to set it. . ."
"The tempered glass film in the set is broken, but the packaging carton is not broken, but the items inside are completely broken and cannot be used. What conscience does the merchant have?"
"The screen cracked just three days after I bought it. Is it made of clay? I don’t know how the screen broke, it’s really hurtful. Isn't it toughened glass?"
"When playing a video, the lower half of the screen will flash a blue screen! Don't know what's going on! Find the solution! ! !"
"We agreed to issue an invoice, but they never came, and complaining is of no use?"
"Yeah, okay, it’s worth it. I’m using it now. But I used to give a tempered film and a protective case as a gift. Now I don’t have them anymore. Well, it’s indeed cheaper than before. Things are good. I have always trusted JD.com for digital products."
Bought this for my mother. The battery broke a few days after I bought it. I often can’t hear the sound during phone calls.
No buttons are too silly
"Flashy, failed, good at first, but stuck after a week! Honor of Kings often freezes, and I will never buy a Huawei phone again! Everyone, look at p10's creation of *, stealing the beam and changing the pillar!"
"This is the first time I have come into contact with Huawei products (I have heard about them before). I have just used them for two months and found a blue line in the middle of the screen, which is very obvious. The image of Huawei in my mind has dropped a lot. Is it genuine or not."
"It feels fine in the hand, but I chose the wrong address when placing the order. After canceling the order and placing the order again, the case and film will not be sent. I contacted customer service and kept pushing back without any reasonable explanation."
It’s great for watching TV and has enough power to last you a whole day. Played Pesticide King for 5 hours. Not stuck at all. What I'm unhappy about is the additional tempered film I purchased. He actually broke it with such intention. 39 yuan is enough if you don’t use it for a day! So angry!
"Visual inspection is pretty good, I just received it, the express delivery is very good, haha"
"I bought 3 tablets, and 2 of them were broken. It took almost 2 months for them to be repaired, but I still haven’t received the goods. I’m giving them the worst and worst negative reviews."
"This tablet is very good, it runs fast, the screen is very clear, the sound quality is very good, the wifi signal is strong, and everything else is good except that it has no call function."
"The speed is very fast, it is easy to use, and I am very satisfied!"
Huawei is a big brand. I have used it for a while before I can evaluate it. The machine is very easy to use. The price/performance ratio is very high. I trust Huawei and the delivery is fast.
"Bought for a friend, support domestic products!"
"Bai Xuefeng: ""The rope is pulled diagonally, so it doesn't work hard."" As expected of a graduate of Inner Mongolia Normal University, he must have accidentally drank too much Mengniu, NC! An apology must be made."
"Why don't you give me selfie sticks when others give them to you? It says 16g of memory above and on the box, but why does it say 11g of memory in the file management? Isn't this a scam?"
"I accidentally bought a bottle of Mengniu! Sin, sin, sin..."
"The screen is generally a bit whitish, and I can't adjust it. Even after flashing the phone, it doesn't work. I'm too lazy to return it."
"fallacy? Grassroots officials in Inner Mongolia: There is nothing wrong with Mengniu and Yili, but the source is unsafe http:t.cn/zjzVHW4 (Shared from @Sina Finance)"
"I've been using the product for two days, is it okay?"
"This is the third Huawei M2 I bought. One for my dad and one for my niece. I bought it for my son today! The memory is not small, and it comes with a flash memory card, which is great! Trust Huawei and support domestic products! ???"
"I think there is something wrong with this person's mind. Inner Mongolia grassroots officials: There is nothing wrong with Mengniu and Yili, but the source is unsafe http:t.cn/zjzXSgs (Shared from @Sina Finance)"
"The quality is really not that good. Just two days after I bought it, it crashed every day and no software was installed. It’s really enough."
"The Huawei brand mobile phones I have been using feel good, economical and practical. If I trust Huawei and buy a Huawei tablet, I believe you will not be disappointed!"
What I hate the most is you who spoil the whole pot of porridge! Mengniu
Why is there lag when playing CrossFire Gun Battle King?
"When I bought it, I could obviously use the interest-free installment coupon, but I was not allowed to use it. As a result, I spent an extra * yuan to buy this phone. It was rubbish. Why did you give me the interest-free installment coupon if you were not allowed to use it? It is about to expire."
"What love is there? ? Why are there so many people shouting downstairs, ""Get married."" . . . . . . . . It's too easy to be moved. . . Can I get a container of Mengniu as a gift if I confess my love in the future?"
"Value for money, I will buy it next time!"
"Let’s not talk about things first. I heard that a certain boss said that only SF Express and JD Logistics will be left in the future. I also tried JD Express by the way. The order was placed on June 18th and the goods arrived on June 24th, with coordinates in Nanjing. It's really great"
"I can’t use my phone card, I can’t use anything without Wifi, I don’t want to give it a single star, and there is no customer service, I don’t even want to ask, I regret buying it. . ."
"The Internet was not very good at first, and I always couldn't get on. Later, I got better after doing various things, but the picture was still a little lacking in some places, and the sound was quite loud."
Not as good as expected. It feels worse than Xiaomi’s
The black edges are so terrifying that not to mention aircraft carriers and starships can land!
"The express delivery is great and the service is very considerate. There was a slight problem with the product I received at the beginning. After communicating with the customer service, I quickly replaced it with a new one. The service is quite satisfactory. I just received the tablet yesterday and it is currently in use~"
How sad! Can Mengniu still be eaten? Why! ! ! Shocked...
"The configuration is too low, the price is unreasonable, and there are no highlights!"
"Logistics is so crappy, it took nine days to receive the goods"
I’ve been using it for nearly a month and I think it’s ok. Just upload the picture.
I always buy things from JD.com. The logistics is very fast and the service is very good.
"Something went wrong after using it for a month, but the after-sales service was very good and they fixed it."
The resolution is extremely low and sometimes the pictures are not clear
"The price was reduced as soon as it arrived. Damn..., there is no purchase invoice yet! ! !"
"The resolution is too low, some cards"
Don’t buy this rubbish tablet.
Didn't it say 16G? Why did I see that my storage capacity was only 11.27? The customer service actually asked me to restore the factory settings. I bought a new one. Please give me a satisfactory answer.
"Did your mother force the regulatory authorities to die? /Scary, don’t eat Mengniu products anymore. Since the Sanju incident, Mengniu and Yili have been banned by me and my family! Boycott all Mengniu products. This company is already rotten."
It’s terrible. It doesn’t even have the most basic standard equipment. It doesn’t even come with headphones. I’m so angry.
"Although I grabbed it at a special price of *yuan, I seriously doubt it is a second-hand phone based on the packaging! Very unhappy..."
"It's rubbish. It says that the stand and earphones are not included at all, and the memory card pops out when inserted. Moreover, when I bought it, it was discounted *the next day*, which is rubbish on JD.com."
"It’s good so far, I hope the quality is good and I’ll review it later"
"Generally, nothing was given, not headphones, nor invoices. I took it to the sales office to have the film applied, and they said it was a refurbished phone in 2015. The price is too expensive, and digital products really cannot be purchased online."
"The screen is clear and the system is smooth, but the edges are a bit scratchy"
"Give a bad review, give a one star is for the courier brother! When the stuff comes in the mail, it doesn’t even include headphones, let alone giving it away, it’s rubbish."
"The mold was folded when it came out, and there was a big bubble after it was attached! Bad review! !"
"Chinese dairy companies are both loved and hated. Love, because Mengniu and Guangming are national enterprises after all, and we cannot destroy our own prestige and enhance the ambition of others. Hate, because there are live insects in the milk of Meng, and there are spoiled milk in the light."
"The mobile phone was so-so. What I didn’t expect was that the price was reduced a few hours after placing the order. I asked if the price difference would be paid. The customer service seemed to be able to ask only once. I kept asking and changing customer service, so there was no result at all. I was disappointed!"
"Paralysis, the screen freezes even after playing Cool Run every day, holy shit, 1,600 to buy a piece of garbage?"
"Request a return. The quality is too low. Dead screen, just jump when listening to music. The font is too small to be used. not worth"
"The express delivery is very fast. If you buy it the day before, it will arrive the next day. JD.com is fast. Bought this for my son. I don’t know if it is easy to use. I will comment after using it."
Huawei (HUAWEI) M2 8.0-inch tablet computer 1920×1200 Kirin 930 Harman Kardon sound effect 3G/16G WiFi) Moonlight Silver
Jingdong is so deceptive. I only bought it a few days ago and the price was * yuan. It’s so depressing.
"This is the first time I have used a Huawei tablet. It is really amazing. The appearance is very beautiful and the system is very smooth. The biggest highlight is that the sound quality is very good. I recommend it, and the price was very favorable when I bought it."
"I don’t drink Mengniu, eat cut cakes, buy domestic milk powder, watch Xinwen Lianbo, or take the Hangzhou subway. . . They are one of the few survival rules that I must adhere to."
"The video on the phone is not clear, and neither are the calls or photos."
I have been using it for a week to evaluate it. I feel that the product is good and genuine. The machine is very smooth. Now the domestic products are getting better and better. I support domestic products. Stop talking nonsense and just go to the picture.
"Since it broke down in less than a month and cannot be turned on, you get what you pay for. I will never use a domestic machine again."
"I used to hear friends say that Huawei phones are good, but now I think they are rubbish."
"Brand new, mainstream, no lag, smooth, likeable, practical."
Boycott Mengniu!
I haven’t bought Mengniu for a long time!
"The screen is not good, there are vertical lines inside"
Support Mengniu as always!
Stay away from Mengniu
"The stuff is good, but the resolution is a bit low, overall it’s okay"
Not even a pair of headphones
"I bought two at once, one for my father and one for my father-in-law, as a New Year gift. The two elders are happy"
"After-sales service is poor, and worry-free refund is of no use."
"All kinds of cards are just rubbish, buy them carefully."
"It is worthy of being called a domestic high-end machine, with affordable price, good quality, very clear screen and super fast response speed! Support domestic production and support Huawei! Huawei is really good, very beautiful, and very convenient to have in hand!"
"I couldn't wait for the notification to install it, so I installed it myself. Used for several days, good"
"JD.com is so irresponsible for its products. When the product breaks down, the maintenance progress is slow and irresponsible."
The system is smooth and looks elegant!
"The reason why it hasn’t gone bad is because there are too many preservatives, right? Is there also cow urine? ? Also, how did you determine the list of consumers? How much compensation? Are they two boxes of Mengniu that have not expired? ? Don't be too ridiculous, or you'll get a pain in the ass!"
I bought it for my son to learn Chinese characters and pinyin. I watched the video and it just gave me an annual membership card. It’s great.
The packaging box is quite exquisite and original. Not used yet.
"Just bought it on the eighth day, and it dropped by * yuan. What about us? Huawei mobile phones do not maintain their value! !"
"I bought it for my kids for study, it’s pretty good."
"Okay, it’s pretty good, it’s pretty big, it’s okay, it’s pretty good, it’s pretty convenient, ah, it runs pretty fast, it doesn’t generate heat, it does generate heat, and it’s very well received."
"I inserted a 128g flash memory card, but it always has to be restarted before it can be recognized, which is really frustrating."
The screen keeps malfunctioning
"I didn’t buy Mengniu before, I don’t buy Mengniu now, and I won’t buy Mengniu in the future!"
"Overall, I'm quite satisfied. Listening to music, watching movies, and playing games all work well."
"The tablet feels good to use, the price/performance ratio is good, and the battery is durable."
Still like the taste-Mengniu pure milk
It’s very useful. My aunt has used it and her two little sisters also want to buy it.
"Damn, no wonder the strawberry yogurt I had for dinner tasted so bad. I bought the wrong Mengniu one!!! I hope I won’t get sick."
The packaging is so rubbish
"Very good, my family likes it very much, recommend it"
"Many applications have no resources, bad reviews!"
It’s not bad. It’s just right for my mother to play with. It’s big enough and there are no pre-installed or bundled software. I’m very satisfied with it.
It’s a nice thing to use!
"The sound quality and picture are very good, and it is easy to carry. Nowadays, the quality of domestic tablets is also very good."
"Looks good, haven't opened it yet. What’s frustrating is that the order was placed on the 27th, but there will be a new event on the 28th. I don’t know if Huawei, which is made in China, can give me a protective case?"
"It’s been almost half a month since I got the tablet. Let me talk about my experience. Watching the video is really enjoyable. The picture quality is clear, the music and appearance are good."
"Poor performance, poor battery life"
"Good, good, good, good"
"Aura, I really like his smile, good looks, and stupid kindness. He must be great at everything. The first time I saw Fanfan was on the Mengniu Music Chart."
"The machine is very good, but it is a little hot, but the performance is good"
I bought 3 items and only sent one. It showed that the order was completed. I contacted customer service and said to give me feedback. The Chinese New Year is coming soon. When will JD.com solve the problem?
It looks good and is easy to use.
The heating of mobile phones is also a very magical thing. It can be used to keep warm in winter!
"Grandma's, it's so rotten, bad review"
It was completed automatically before the goods were received. No one answered the call to the delivery person. What happened?
"This Huawei tablet is cost-effective and can meet the requirements of use. However, the resolution is a bit lower. This is the price. You can’t ask for too much."
"It broke after a short period of time and the phone could not be turned on. When I asked where to repair it, the service was not good. Now that it is bad, I will not buy anything from this store anymore."
"Currently using it, pretty good? Jingdong is self-operated. Do you like it very much?"
"wipe! Thank you for trusting Mengniu so much! Fortunately, I only drink Yili =-= Too disgusting Repost on Weibo"
"It arrived the next day. I just used it. It looks okay, but the pixels are a bit low. I bought a 32G memory card myself. Why is there an extra hole in the upper right corner of the protective film? And why don’t you have an invoice? Let's talk about it after some time."
"This tablet is generally good, but it gets a little hot. But the logistics is fast and the service is good!"
Watching TV series is smooth and satisfying.
"China Unicom is not as good as China Mobile, 7Up is not as good as Sprite, Keke is not as good as Pepsi, pure milk is better than Mengniu, kefir is better than Yili, doomsday, hello, me, everyone, national Haodi"
Po Jingdong your sister
I bought this for my dad. He can just watch TV and the battery is enough. It’s pretty good.
"As soon as I bought it, the price was reduced to *$! Are you playing with me? How funny!"
"Not bad, it’s very smooth to use, the sound quality for listening to music is also good, the camera pixels are also very good, and the photos taken are quite beautiful, haha?"
"The phone I received did not have plastic packaging or a warranty sticker, so it was obviously returned. It's attached with transparent tape! If it's not urgently needed, I'll definitely return it!"
"It feels great to use, much faster than my original ipad mini"
The packaging is very beautiful and the delivery is very practical! The only drawback is that the frame is too wide and the clarity is too fake! Huawei has represented China to the world in recent years!
"Although it is from Mengniu, the vegetarian food is really delicious, and it feels more flavorful than Bangzi’s banana milk. Finally, I would like to thank Boss Fei for his financial support!"
"The order placed on the 19th was shipped out of the warehouse at around 11am on the 20th. It was shown that it was delivered on the 20th, but it was not delivered until the 21st. I contacted customer service and replied that I would wait patiently. Jingdong's service is getting worse and worse."
"The running speed is okay, and I can take pictures, but why is it so hot when nothing is turned on? ? And it consumes power faster."
"The screen has bad pixels, customer service is indifferent, garbage"
The packaging is too poor. Insufficient sealing. I don’t know if it has been dismantled or not.
Not even headphones! ! ! ! ! Rubbish! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"The first time I used it it was good, but the film was not applied properly. It is recommended to call a professional when applying the film!"
The sound started to break after a month of purchase. Bad review!
"I bought it on the first day and then lowered the price the next day. Is this a scammer? The * thing is packaged like this, a rotten cardboard box. It’s really not as good as *"
"The performance of the tablet is great, the speed is very fast, it feels very fast to use, and the express delivery is very fast. I placed the order in the morning and it arrived in the afternoon. I am very satisfied!"
"Very good, very cost-effective, quick response"
"After purchasing, the delivery was very fast. I learned from the experience and lessons of netizens and unpacked JD.com’s outer packaging on the spot - it turned out to be an old machine that had been unpacked from the original packaging. I asked for a return on the spot."
"The baby is very good, I use it quickly, and my dad likes it very much! I haven't received the goods yet, and the price has dropped by more than 100! !"
"I don’t like drinking Mengniu either~ Alas alas I don’t drink it, how dare I not drink Sanyuan milk?"
"I just received the goods and it hasn’t arrived yet, so I took it apart to take a look."
"The logistics is very fast, and the tablet is good to use, but there is no data cable.,,"
The old man is quite satisfied! properly
It's okay. I've been using it for two days and I haven't found any problems. The speed is okay.
"I've been using it for two days, and overall it's pretty good, with good performance in all aspects. It just gets hot when playing games."
"Bought for kids, it's very loud. At the beginning, I was worried that it would not be easy to use, but after using it for a while, it worked very well. Everyone, hurry up and buy"
"The photo effect is very good, hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha"
Good reviews. This is my second purchase. Good quality and low price.
"The 2K screen display is okay, I bought it for my girlfriend. She said it was great to play Honor of Kings and watch TV"
It only broke after a month of use. The speaker suddenly turns on and off automatically during a call.
1 star is more leisure
"What you want is the call version, the one that has been sent cannot be used for calls. After asking customer service for several days, there was no solution. So irritating"
"One word difference, two words difference, difference"
"It's good to use, but I don't know about the future."
"I have been buying it for a month, but it always shuts down automatically. I communicated with the merchant and made various excuses. Huawei is too unreliable. I won’t say what the problem is. I will never buy Huawei again."
"The tablet screen is very clear, the resolution is also very high, there are few pre-installed applications, and playing King of Kings is very smooth. The customer service is also very patient. JD.com’s logistics is super fast. The order placed at 5pm arrived the next morning, great!"
The product has just arrived. It feels pretty good. I would like to ask if there is a film on the bare metal. I looked at it for a long time and I can’t see if it is.
"The response is quite slow, not very good, not as good as expected, very disappointing"
"fine. I bought it for my wife to watch videos and go shopping in the mall. It is enough. After struggling with the iPad, I finally bought the cheaper one."
Mengniu's execution is so fast! Love Mengniu so much!
"Mengniu, are you happy?"
"The stuff is good, JD.com is super fast, I give a thumbs up to JD.com for the next day experience. Huawei has always been good, and everyone in my family uses Huawei phones. A gift for my mother-in-law, I love it."
I just received the Huawei M2-803L 32GB. I will try it out for a few days and then review it.
"Give it a five-star rating. Many game phones can’t afford it. For example, the game “Ball Battle” is extremely laggy. But other aspects are fine. The power consumption is also very slow, so it’s okay."
"Absolutely bad review, it was in stock when I took the photo, but it took several days after the photo was taken to be shipped."
"It was installed and used very well. The after-sales service is very good. I have been asking about the installation and usage. When I bought it, I was worried that no one would care or ask. Midea products are trustworthy."
"Very bad, very stuck"
"It’s okay, no problem for now! Support domestic production! Support domestic production, support domestic production, say important things three times!"
"It's pretty good. It looks beautiful, has a huge screen, has good running memory, can make calls, and can connect to wifi. It's really good."
"Very beautiful, good for watching movies, good tablet, fast internet speed, good sound quality, fast speed, clear screen, system runs smoothly and fast"
Very useful. Watching the video is enough
"I have been drinking Meng milk for more than 4 years. This time I switched to Yili milk on a whim. As a result, I often have stomach upsets. Is it Mengniu that ruined my stomach, or Yili that ruined my breakfast? ?"
The delivery was very fast and the product is in use. It’s okay.
Why I am very optimistic about the boycott and firmly boycott Mengniu
"Very good, just like what I saw"
"If a word is bad, it means bad."
"The price I bought yesterday is reduced today, and it doesn’t support price protection. It’s disgusting! What the hell!"
It is a great value to buy this tablet during this event. The response speed is smooth and the appearance is good. The only drawback is that the black borders of the tablet are a bit big.
"If you just use it to watch videos and comics, it is still enough. If you want to play games at this price, you have to be prepared for lags. Anyway, it was originally used to store extra phone cards, so overall I am quite satisfied."
"It's a good cost-effective machine, but the interface is still old. The phone case I received was not very good. The magnetic induction is very troublesome and the screen will lock when I put it on the back. I really want to cut it off."
very good! The family loves it! No problems so far! Jingdong is still trustworthy!
"The goods are good, but the logistics is really rubbish. I have never seen such logistics."
This mobile phone can be said to be a defective product. The low sound affects normal use. I will never buy Huawei mobile phones again
"The goods have been received. My daughter can’t wait. In short, it’s very good. The logistics and delivery are very fast. It’s very good."
"The seller's service is good and the price is fair~! Haha, I'm not humble anymore. If you want to see more, come on. Okay, don't waste your time, come on!!!!"
"No headphones are delivered, no leather case is delivered, the Internet response is very slow, and the photos are terrible. Please don’t buy it."
It’s very trustworthy. You can watch TV clearly and flawlessly. You can buy it.
"Not even a tempered film was given, and I felt my heart was broken. . ."
"It doesn’t have too high requirements, it’s for children, and overall it’s cost-effective~"
"The price changes again and again, and the screen proportions are inconsistent, a bit like a larger mobile phone. After I bought it, the price dropped again. I was very helpless, so I returned it and bought a Nokia n1. I thought that one was better."
"Huawei is rubbish, you will be black forever, it’s bullshit."
"Huawei, Huawei. I bought it as a gift and almost broke off the relationship. What a piece of garbage."
"The screen cracked when I dropped it lightly, so sad."
this board. The screen will flicker at low brightness. JD.com and Huawei customer service solutions instead restore the system and upgrade. Useless to say. Sit back and wait for the change of plane. Otherwise it's a common problem.
"I like Mengniu, what about you?"
"Apart from the tablet and charger, nothing was given as a gift. Even the protective film had to be paid 30 yuan to apply in the store. Is it cold?"
"Not bad, I like it"
paralysis! It feels like it has been used and was poorly packaged! A little dirty! accurate
"The middle frame is curved, it is definitely a returned product! Can you please stop being so stupid?"
It's pretty good
"Not satisfied, the seller is too generous and does not come with earphones or protective cases."
"I regret buying it, it’s not that good"
"New changes to the new Mengniu, changing the soup without changing the dressing, adding ingredients without increasing the price~"
"An Yi is miserable. . . Dinner: Pasta, dq ice cream for dessert, Mengniu real fruit slices, and late night potato noodles. I am exhausted and absolutely fat. The key is that I am so sleepy now. . ."
"It's ok at first, I hope it lasts a long time. Sometimes there are ghost images when watching the video barrage, which may be due to the screen quality. Generally speaking, it is good? Huawei can still be trusted."
"Very good, simple and elegant appearance, suitable size, powerful functions..."
"Generally speaking, it's okay. It's just that charging is super slow, but it's super fast. I charged it to 30% in a few hours, and I used it in half an hour. When comparing the battery capacity - who can compete?"
"generally,,,,,,,,,"
"The packaging is in good condition, JD.com is very fast. I have just received the tablet and haven’t used it yet. I will review it later. I’ll give you a good review first."
"I still miss Senior Sun’s visit to Mengniu back in those days, so I’ll go home and have a look. So kind!"
I just bought it and haven’t used it yet. I want to say thank you to the delivery person for their hard work! It’s almost ten o’clock at night and they are still delivering goods!
"If there are unacceptable major problems in the future, I will make a supplementary review. After all, Android tablets cannot compare with Apple tablets. I personally don’t like Apple’s closedness. Everyone has different opinions and takes what they need. For the reference of friends in need."
Do you need such a big box? I haven’t found any problems after using it for a few days. The only regret is that 618 does not have any discounts.
"The phone is hot and crashed just after using it. There are two small holes above the volume button. I seriously suspect that it is a repaired phone. Dear friends, please check it carefully before considering buying it. Jingdong customer service promised to send a replacement mobile phone case and memory card, but nothing happened... Hei Zai"
"The order she placed yesterday arrived this morning, and she was very satisfied. She hasn’t used the function yet, so I’ll review it after I did."
Very good. The best DI price I bought before 618.
"It's so bad, I don't know how it got the good reviews. This is true even if you buy it at a special price."
That's all. Talking about the standby captain is pure deception!
The sound is too low!
"The baby couldn't wait to open it as soon as I received it. The packaging is very tight, there is no bump at all, and the white color is very generous. Would it be great if there were gifts? I haven't used it yet in terms of performance. I will review it after using it. I am very satisfied at the moment."
"Less than a month later, there are many problems. . . . Speechless"
"It’s pretty good at this stage, let’s see what the experience is like in the future!"
I bought it for my mother. She likes it very much. I tried it and it was ok. It’s pretty fast. Mainly just because I like it.
"Very satisfied, I will comment on others after using it."
"Mengniu, please close down quickly."
The logistics speed is very fast and the game is very smooth. The price/performance ratio is good and worth buying.
"Fast logistics, satisfactory product, a satisfying purchase!"
"Very good, it took me a long time to comment."
"I don’t know why, but I feel like I’m not very good at playing it, maybe it’s not very easy to use, ugh. . ."
"@???Xu Lai: The first card, the Transportation Youth Card, was clicked on according to the space. After filling out the application information, I didn’t expect that the credit report call came in less than five minutes. It was also fast enough [smile]"
"The most unhappy purchase I've ever made. It took eight days to ship the goods, even though I had to rush for the goods every day. I'm speechless."
"I just want to say one word, Ka"
"No, the phone is hot"
"Speed, speed, speed, speed, very fast, I have to buy it."
"Gratitude is not about the form, what matters is the heart. In the early morning, prepare a box of Jindian milk for dad and mom on the coffee table; before going out, carefully tell your parents: ""Pay more attention to your health"", which will make them happier and better."
"The starting price is 618,998. I personally feel that the Apple system is cumbersome to use, so I decided to buy an Android tablet. It is simple and convenient to use and meets the requirements of audio-visual entertainment. Battery life basically meets the requirements."
"I bought it for my husband, but it broke within a few days and the screen became damaged."
"Cutting cakes cheats money, Mengniu cheats lives!"
What a bad thing I bought for the first time. Bad review.
Mengniu is so unethical in doing things that only harm mainlanders. Repost on Weibo
A gift for my mother. It runs fast and plays movies well. It’s a very good tablet.
The sound effect is very good and the display is also good. I have never used Apple's and it feels great.
"When I put the case on the phone, I found a small 1mm crack, which may have been broken by me, but it doesn't matter. It's more pretentious to use than Apple, and the rate of return is higher!"
"Overall, it's fine, but there will be lags when viewing PDF files."
"The logistics is very fast, the computer is also very good, it is fun to play games, my son likes it very much! The courier guy is very enthusiastic and satisfied!"
"Too difficult to use. . . . . ,,"
"Not bad, the speed is very fast. My friends said that it is very good for watching videos and so on. At this price, there is nothing to complain about."
Huawei honors the pride of the Chinese people. We firmly support Huawei and boycott the United States and Japan. There is nothing to say about the quality.
"Mengniu, your oat milk tastes terrible. I soaked oats and milk together and it tastes better than yours."
"It's ok, looks stylish and runs fast."
"It’s too average, runs laggy, and has a poor screen. It’s better to buy a phone with the same price level."
"The logistics is very good, it works well and the speed is very fast."
"The sound effect is far from amazing. The two speakers are quite loud, but they vibrate when turned up loudly."
"Although the logistics is a bit slow, the tablet is still OK. This is the first day of use and there are no problems."
The front and rear cameras have high pixels and high-definition photos.
"Domestic machines can also play good cards. When playing games, the cards are so bad that I want to smash them. Won't buy it a second time"
I’m late to comment. It’s a very easy-to-use tablet with good value for money. I can watch movies and play games without any lag. I give it a thumbs up!
"I placed the order on January 26th and received it on January 27th. I am still very satisfied with JD.com’s logistics, but today is only April 21st! It’s not even 3 months yet! It can’t be used anymore! ! ! Currently communicating with customer service!"
Very fast logistics. I received the order I placed last night and received it this morning. Thank you for the fast delivery.
"It was said that you would receive a Tencent Video membership with every order, but unfortunately I didn’t see a membership card."
"I would like to ask, why does the tablet I bought on August 8 contain videos from July 15? Please explain, is it so deceptive? They all say they support domestic production and domestic products. Can people believe this?"
"The battery is not good, 95% of the power is charged, and it automatically shuts down after half a day of standby."
What is it? The sound is too low to be heard. There is a quality problem~~~~
"The tablet is awesome, and the 2K screen is really worth it! It’s so cool to watch Chu Qiao’s fax! I bought an M2 Youth Edition before and I will buy an M3 again. I believe in Huawei's quality!"
"Support domestic products, support Huawei..."
Jingdong garbage customer service is poor
"It's very smooth to use, the magnesium aluminum alloy is tall, and the heat dissipation is excellent."
I bought this for my dad on Father's Day. The quality is good and he likes it very much!
"When I bought a new mobile phone, there was a bit of lag and the charger was broken. I used another charger to recharge the battery. I contacted the mobile phone supplier and they asked me to contact JD Express. Are the two sides playing ball? The goods are yours, who should be responsible?"
"Too bad, the price is falsely high. The Price Bureau should really check the building."
"I've been using it for a while, but it's not working well. I've had to repair it twice."
"I gave it to my mother to watch the show, she said she liked it very much"
"Sure enough, it deserves its reputation - Mengniu is really a cow~moo--"
"Bought for the elderly, very good!"
The guy from JD Express delivered the goods in the rain and did a great job. The feel is okay but the black edges are too big. I’ll review it after using it later.
"The mobile phone case was missing, and not even the small speaker was given. My family received it, and I plan to return it."
"Big screen, very comfortable to watch movies, not bad"
"It should be fine. I bought it from JD.com. The machine died once in the middle, but there are no other problems."
After-sales service is too bad
It was a very unpleasant shopping experience. JD.com sent the wrong goods and was slow to return or exchange goods. It showed no sincerity at all. It is not a big company and it only wants to complain about rubbish.
Why do you want to lower the price and give me something as a gift after I buy it? Why do you do this? How can I trust you in the future? Jingdong. How can I feel so embarrassed? I’m sad. I’m sad. I’ll give you a bad review. Who made me sad?
Jingdong's logistics is fast and the goods are good. It is worth recommending. I will come again next time.
"The delivery speed is fast, Jingdong shopping is safe and affordable. The Nokia n1 I bought before has broken, so I bought this one for my child. I hope it will last longer."
It’s a practical mobile phone. Everyone will ask if it’s a tablet and can it fit in a pocket? But it’s really domineering!
"The big screen looks good, I have been using it for a while"
"Very satisfied, especially the sound is very good and the memory is large enough. Bought this for my mom as a Mother's Day gift, she really likes it. I always buy electronic products from JD.com, the prices are affordable and the quality is guaranteed."
"Supports WiFi, but does not support mobile phone 4G. It's pretty smooth to use, but there will be some lag when opening photos, from blurry to clear."
"It's rubbish, it's poor, it's obsolete, the resolution is very low, it's not comparable to Redmi at the same price, it's embarrassing to give it away."
"Things are okay, but JD Logistics is so bad!"
"hehe. The product arrived so quickly, which is not bad."
"1. The packaging is very high-end, 2. It comes with a screen sticker (but I didn’t use it), 3. Fortunately, it is a charging cable with a universal interface, 4. The screen and sound effects are very good; 5. The thickness measured with a vernier caliper is 7.3-7.4cm. very thin"
So-so.
Hahahahahahahahaha
"It's not JD.com's problem, I'm very disappointed with p9! I am very disappointed. I bought the mobile phone for three days and it got stuck while playing games. What else can I say? I really want to return the product"
"Why does Huawei pre-install some useless software that cannot be uninstalled? If you buy this phone, remember to buy a clutch bag! And why do you need to install a mobile assistant to make a USB flash drive?"
"I have never seen such rubbish. Within a week, there was a problem with the machine, and customer service was nowhere to be found."
"The tablet I purchased is good, I will continue to pay attention next time."
"Much better than expected, and the delivery was fast. I just want to ask if the one I bought does not have a protective cover and explosion-proof film!"
"I don’t want to give it even one star. JD.com’s approach is so disappointing. There was a leather case delivered before placing the order, but it didn’t arrive when it arrived."
"Mengniu is like the H base camp, no longer favorite but still indispensable; when losing power, it will worry but not chaos; when gaining power, it will rely on pampering but not coquettishness;"
"Not a single gift, I will never buy again."
"Good, very good. Much better than expected. Especially everything is good."
"The charging port is not straight and difficult to plug in. Based on this, I immediately feel that this tablet is not good. I don’t have much comment on other aspects. Anyway, I regret it. I still have to buy an Apple tablet. 7"
"It's okay. The battery standby time is not as good as Apple's. If you don't have particularly high requirements for games or something, you can buy it."
"Fast and timely, good service."
"Huawei M3 is really good, the size is just right, and it’s great to play King of Kings. The iPad is too big, and it’s too difficult to operate by hand. This one is just right, it’s smooth, and the battery is durable. Good reviews."
Not great. There was a bit of lag on the first day it was delivered and the resolution was not good.
"Good, the screen is big, suitable for the elderly"
"The delivery speed is fast, I bought it before going to bed and it was delivered before I woke up. There is such a big black border and the video cannot be played continuously."
Better than expected
"I just got it at noon and am using it to write a review now. Yesterday’s flash sale price was actually ten yuan higher than usual. It’s not that I lacked the ten yuan, but it was too unethical! ! M3j is like a large mobile phone, hahaha???"
I received the tablet. It’s so beautiful. I like it. It’s very light and runs fast. I received it the next day after logistics.
"Huawei is really not that good now. The last time I bought Huawei, the system response was really slow! !"
"The speed is a bit slow, but it's still acceptable. It's mainly used for sending and receiving WeChat messages. Don't buy it if you play games. The video resolution is average, but it's still acceptable."
"The call function does not work. I found a problem before I even used it. The first time I returned it for repair, it was still not fixed. The after-sales service was extremely poor and took a long time."
It's pretty good. It's fun to use the big screen. It feels smooth when you look at it.
"The display is really not high definition enough. The UI is not good enough either. Some software adaptations are not perfect. Battery capacity is average. I particularly hate the virtual navigation keys on this machine... Anyway, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends to place an order."
That's rubbish. . . . . . . .
"Not bad, pretty good, super invincible! I especially like shopping on JD.com, the stuff is also very good! I support you Brother Dong! Will repurchase this unlimited times!"
Playing games and watching live broadcasts is no problem
"Not bad, the exterior design is beautiful."
"Sorry, why is the price lower than Double Eleven?"
"It’s too deceptive to not get anything when you buy it, but to get so many things after you buy it. . . . . The battery is not very durable and the real screen is too small."
"The stuff is very good, logistics is fast"
"Okay, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok"
The signal is ridiculously poor. The package was squashed when I received it. There is light in the upper right corner of the screen. I really wonder if it is a copycat version.
"The screen is not very good, so I can only make do with it."
The logistics is fast and the quality is pretty good. Huawei can really do it.
"This time I spent too much time shopping on JD.com. The goods promised to arrive the next day were delayed for four days, and the compensation Jingdou promised from customer service failed to materialize. It was too unreliable. I am seriously disappointed with JD.com this time!"
"It's a large version of a mobile phone, used for talking to clients. Hope to get my money back soon"
Logistics is too slow
"The photo was taken in the evening of 11.2. The next morning, the price was reduced by 100 and there was a gift. I found a price difference and reduced the coupon I used. The gift was not compensated. It's really good. What kind of service! So angry! ! !"
The express delivery is very fast and very good
"Well, it is very smooth to use, but it takes a long time and sometimes there will be a little lag."
"The price fluctuates so much, **It feels like it happened in minutes~ It fell off before it was delivered** The battery of the mobile phone is very durable, but what does it mean that there is no floating window~"
It’s a crappy thing. The price dropped right after I bought it. The price guarantee doesn’t work. JD.com is really rubbish now.
I'm so pissed off when the price was reduced before I even got the goods.
Jingdong is unreasonable and refuses to return goods. It’s a waste of my trust in you.
"After using it for a while, I still can’t find the reason. There is a wireless network but I can’t get online. What should I do?"
A very bad shopping experience on JD.com...
"It's pretty good, but the resolution is a bit low, and the photos are pretty good."
The price is right and there is nothing particularly dissatisfying about using it. But one drawback is that the screen always locks automatically. I wonder if it is due to improper operation.
It's still very good. I can make and receive calls very well without any lag.
"The phone doesn’t work. After using it for a month, the screen went white several times, the fonts couldn’t be seen clearly, and the touch screen was a bit laggy."
"The baby has been received, the quality is very good!"
We're going crazy! ! ! @ Mengniu can’t cheer up
Mengniu advertising has begun to take the warm and high-end route.
"Very easy to use, good quality and low price"
I bought it to watch the video. It’s pretty good and the price is affordable.
"Even though it was so busy on June 18, the courier still delivered it to my hands on the 20th. Although it was later than usual, I was very touched. Thank you JD.com for your continued support!"
"^^Mengniu is so pure, I like it, @ Mengniu micro customer service"
This is the least sour yogurt I have ever tasted in the world. . . Mengniu has disappointed me again.
I bought it at a special price. I like it very much. It supports Huawei. The tablet is really good. I don’t know how much better it is than the p7 I have been using for 3 years?
Those who don’t want to eat bugs should stay away from Mengniu and boycott it! ! !
"As always, support Huawei."
"Very poor, short standby time, unable to play games."
"The boot system was upgraded to Android 7, which was quite smooth. The sound is good and the quality of the tablet is excellent"
The edge of the tablet is uneven and there is air in the film! I have posted 3 pictures with the same effect! Ask the manufacturer to give me an explanation!
"You get what you pay for. If you have money, it’s better to buy one with better configuration! This one is also worth the money!"
The resolution is too low. You get what you pay for.
"Look how much I support hometown industries! This is the second box since this morning! And be impartial. After drinking Mengniu, drink Yili! This ice milk really makes me feel cool and refreshed!"
Not satisfied! Bought two together! One of them reacted very slowly! It’s stuck! Contact the seller and ask me to go to the outlet! It's too far from our home! Just bought it three or four days ago! So angry!
"The resolution was low, and the price was reduced just four days after purchase. The customer service also refused the customer's reasonable appeal on the grounds that the flash sale did not participate in price protection."
"When giving gifts in rural areas, it is better to give Mengniu. If the voice is authentic, Mengniu is better."
Whoever buys this junk tablet will regret it. It’s only been 5 months and now it can’t be turned on or charged.
The camera pixels are too low and the photos are not clear at all!
"Jingdong tried its best to fool people by using some rework machines, but when they used it, they saw that the tempered film on the screen was not removed. It's obviously someone else's product that was returned for repair and resold. Let’s smash the brand on 6.18!"
The quality is very good? This is my second purchase.
"The logistics is very, very slow... I have been waiting for almost ten days... and they still give me nothing! I've been waiting in vain for several days..."
"I have been boycotting. Instead of boycotting Japanese products, it is better to boycott Mengniu."
Mengniu milk tastes pretty good.
The phone broke after just one month after I bought it. What a piece of crap. I hope everyone will read this comment and stop buying this phone. I will never buy anything from JD.com again and I will no longer trust JD.com!
I bought 3 of them. My husband and I each have one. I bought this for a friend.
I’ve bought a lot of them and they always feel good.
fine! children like it very much
"No good, nothing, bare metal, and always breaking down! Bad, bad, bad!"
"I bought it for a friend, and the packaging was said to be very bad, and it wasn't very good to use."
"Good, good, good, good"
"Economical and affordable, JD.com’s quality is trustworthy"
Very good. Used it for a long time. The price is good.
Forgive me for not knowing much about electronic products. It turns out that the promised 16G memory can be directly reduced to 10G. 6 is really not light.
The stuff is good and the quality is pretty good. I’ll buy it again if I have the chance.
"It deformed less than a month after I bought it. I went to the after-sales service and was told that it was for artificial use. I am sick when I step on a horse. Do I deliberately deform it? If you don’t want warranty, just say so. Huawei’s after-sales service is rubbish."
"Boycott Mengniu. If you are shameless and invincible, you will not be able to drink Mengniu even if you beat yourself to death."
The price of 999 is still worth it
The stuff is pretty good. I feel comfortable using it. I’ll come back next time.
"Hold the grass, buy it on the first day, and then reduce the price by 100 the next day? What a lot of meaning!"
It’s not good. It started to get stuck after less than a month of use. The battery ran out all at once. The phone’s standby time is not long and charging is very slow. This is what happens for a product that costs several hundred yuan.
"not bad! After all, Android tablets, I personally think have good value for money! Much cheaper than a physical store!"
"Bad review, bad review, bad review! When I placed the order, it said that I would get free headphones, but they didn’t and they wouldn’t reissue them. Bad review!"
Congratulations to Mengniu for finally surpassing my achievements back then! Get well soon and get back to the greenery!
"The packaging is poor, even the foam is not put, just put in a cardboard box!"
I bought a Mengniu Xiangxue cup and ate something. I looked closely and found it was a fingernail. It was so disgusting! Mengniu Nima is so deceptive! @problem food exposure
"It’s rubbish, it’s 40 off when you first buy it, it doesn’t support price guarantee, and it’s a limited-purchase product. It’s too boring. Let’s talk about the product. The screen resolution is really average, the screen sensitivity is low, and it’s relatively laggy. The advantage is that the screen is big. This is it."
Can Mengniu beat buying lottery tickets?
"Very good, very cost-effective"
"The stuff is good and the logistics is fast. It’s just that it’s much more expensive, and they also come with a protective cover and film, but I don’t have anything."
"I always shop at JD.com, it’s convenient, fast and worry-free!"
"This is crap, please don’t buy it"
Old automatic shutdown. It pissed me off. . .
"The delivery is fast and the packaging is in good condition. I bought it during an event and came with a film and protective cover. It is very cost-effective. The screen resolution and color are also good. I feel confident buying it from Huawei, a big brand. It is a good purchase."
"The screen is gorgeous, really nice. You can see your eyeballs orgasm when you look at the picture!"
It has been two days since I received the baby. The quality is very good. I am very satisfied with it this time. I installed it myself and it was very easy. I am very satisfied with the seller's service and praise it well.
"True love, life, stay away from Mengniu"
"This isn't a mobile phone, it's just a kettle. Customer service also likes to shirk responsibility. Is it so difficult to admit that it's a problem with the mobile phone? I insist that I have too many background programs. This is the first time I know that 3 background programs are too many."
Can. good. Worth buying!
"The product has some flaws, I just discovered them, look at the pictures."
The items are very good and were delivered quickly!
"I didn’t receive the tablet, but received the cup. Is this what JD.com is doing now? Also specially selected Jingdong’s self-operated one? May I ask where my computer went?"
I’m reviewing it after using it for a week. It’s really useful.
Mengniu is embarrassed again
"As shown in the picture, distant objects are clear between the fingers, which can be judged as software blur. However, the product claims that the lens is blurred, which deceives consumers."
"The running speed is too slow, and the service of JD.com is also poor. When I applied for an invoice when purchasing goods, the result was no. What about my credit? I will never buy a loan on JD.com again."
I got a broken electrical appliance and was depressed.
"Huawei tablet is easy to use, responds quickly, and has a beautiful screen"
"The machine is good, feels good and runs smoothly."
"The packaging is in good condition, the delivery speed is great, and the product is even better!"
"I bought it for my elders. It took 3 days for logistics and distribution. I was not very satisfied. It was clearly written that the goods were in stock. After paying the money, I saw that the goods needed to be distributed. Jingdong buys things just for speed. I waited 4 days for it to arrive. I was very disappointed."
"The touch failed after 20 days, it’s so miraculous"
"Canceled, it’s not working, the video is lagging."
"I like it very much, feels good, stable performance, fast, like it"
good.
"No, I haven't used it for a few days and it won't turn on. I replaced it today. I don't know if it was replaced or repaired, but the display color is not as good as before. I just feel like it's not working."
"The description of the product and the picture are consistent, very good"
The logistics is very fast and the packaging is very good. Good reviews! ! !
JD.com is really rubbish. They immediately cut the price after the photo shoot. I will never buy anything from JD.com in the future.
"Good stuff, support domestic products, I will buy a bigger one when I have money."
"Milk, never drink Mengniu! @mengniudairy"
"This tablet is pretty good, runs smoothly, and is enough for daily use."
The performance of the tablet is good and the size is just right. It’s great for office and entertainment.
"The goods have been received, it works well and I am very satisfied with the pixels. The real thing is exactly the same as the picture"
"Very good, support domestic products. . ."
The delivery speed is very fast and it is not stuck in use. It is very good.
"There was nothing wrong with the machine within a few hours of receiving it. I will check again later. The usage experience is quite good, but doesn’t it have a protective film? I didn't see it."
"I bought it to read word and ppt, it comes with office software, great!"
"When I opened the headphones, there was no empty case. I was really drunk."
"Mengniu, just for a little bit of happiness."
"How to practice basic mobile phone film and ordinary mobile phone case? In the past, I bought anything from other people’s houses without even asking! The store is really nice~"
"The screen resolution is very low and I want to return it, but JD electronic products cannot be returned after they are opened. It is better to buy an ipadair at this price."
"Can't make phone calls, so it's okay, it's my first time buying, let's play around with it"
"It’s very easy to use, it’s large and flat, and it’s cost-effective."
"The resolution is so bad, I regret it@_?"
This time I bought something on 618. The delivery was a bit slow. It must have been too busy. Thank you for the hard work of the courier brother. I finally received the product today.
"I am a hard-working person who drinks Mengniu every day. If I don’t drink it, no one will drink it. There are several boxes of it."
"There was a hole in the packaging when I received it, but there are currently no other issues."
Jingdong is really bad! There are scratches on the screen. It’s really hard to spot without looking carefully. There are also scratches on the camera. It’s very frustrating!
The most uncomfortable time must be after drinking Mengniu.
"We don’t need small for Sa, but Mengniu tells the truth."
# Mengniu Pure Milk# The new packaging feels pretty good.
"Watching TV is very smooth, children like it very much, and the battery is fully charged and can be watched for 5.6 hours."
I feel good after using it for a while. I bought it just for watching TV. It’s very affordable.
"The logistics is very good, the packaging box is good, there is a protective air cushion inside, it is very thoughtful, the tablet is also good, the response is very fast"
This phone makes a lot of noise during long calls and cannot be viewed horizontally when watching videos online. This phone has strong negative reviews.
Mengniu is cheap
"Received, very good, has a charger, looks very good, but did not test the machine, tried the machine and started to add more"
"I bought it just for watching movies, but it got stuck while watching the movie. . ."
"It feels like a second-hand refurbished phone, the signal is not full, and there are a lot of software inside, **Meituan headlines, etc. You can see the following pictures. Do you have doubts about JD?"
I just opened it today and haven’t used it yet. It’s just that the logistics packaging was too poor.
"The price drops right after you buy it, JD.com is so rubbish. garbage garbage"
"The stuff is good, I'm quite satisfied with it, and it's worth the price. However, I still recommend buying 4G or 64G, it will run better."
It’s good to buy for others
"Poor service, strong negative reviews, the worst and most disappointing shopping experience ever on JD.com,"
"I originally planned to give it 5 stars, but when I saw the price today, I was stunned."
"Not very good, a bit stuck"
"I am completely disappointed with Mengniu, an irresponsible state-owned enterprise!"
Watching movies and playing games is completely stress-free. The most important thing is that the sound effects are really good. You don’t have to listen to mono sound anymore.
It's very easy to use. It feels very fast and the sound quality is good.
"It is best to drink Mengniu, as it will make you grow stronger!"
"I don’t really like the video, it’s not that good"
"Jingdong's current packaging is getting worse and worse. The boxes are very thin and the foam is gone. The boxes are broken when the items arrive, and they have been separated during harvest. I also lost something last time and I was so disappointed with JD.com! ! !"
"The only tablet you can buy is from Apple. The resolution of this model is very poor and the response is extremely slow. Now it has been thrown away and useless. There are too many pre-installed software. It’s not that it doesn’t support domestic products, it’s really incomparable."
"It feels pretty good, the screen is clear, the photos are good, and it is definitely no problem to play small games. It meets my requirements, so I like it!"
"The express delivery is really great, super fast, and the tablet is also very good, five stars"
"It doesn't work well, it keeps crashing. I bought two units, both are the same. The accessories on this one are also broken, so I was too lazy to replace them."
Mengniu milk tastes bad enough
"This machine is not good. When I play King of Kings, I can't add blood or release skills while the hero is moving. It doesn't feel like multi-touch. I bought it specifically to play King of Kings. Bad review!"
"Let's make do, I can't stand it without the pedometer function. They didn't even offer insurance, so I couldn't bear it. I get disconnected for no apparent reason when surfing the Internet. I can’t bear it anymore. Bad review!"
"Bad, not good"
"It's rubbish. The memory is very small. The main thing is that the more the memory is used, the smaller it becomes. If you install two or three software, you will run out of memory and you can't even clean it up. It's useless. It's so rubbish."
"JD.com is a bastard shopping platform and makes shopping unpleasant. When I bought it, it only came with a leather case, but now it comes with a tempered film. dislike."
"It’s not bad, after all, it’s been a long time since the Thousand Yuan Machine came out."
The product is great. The screen is very good. Huawei’s system is also good. It’s great for playing games and watching videos. The battery is very durable and usually lasts for 2 days. 32 likes for the sound effect. Better than the speakers.
The delivery person was not the familiar JD Express.
"So hard! Just for drinking safe milk! Shenzhen is fucking Mengniu and Yili! Sister, I don’t want to drink! So after all the hard work, my husband brought me some milk and gave it to me~ and my husband’s favorite cream soda!"
Watching videos and practicing yoga is enough
"The boss of the store bullies customers, does not keep his word, and is shameless"
"Very good product, smooth, clear, good sound quality"
"JD.com delivers quickly, and the tablet is good to use."
"Toyota is awesome, boycott Mengniu and Japanese products should strengthen themselves! Why"
"The phone is good, but it’s heavy to hold."
"But this red flag should be celebrating the Double Festival, right? ? Mr. Shi is so wise in life, but he is too thick-faced and has a dark heart. He replies, ""If Mengniu doesn't fail, I really don't have confidence in domestic milk."""
"Supporting domestic production, this is Huawei’s second mobile phone. Good value for money. The key is that the quality of JD.com’s self-operated products is guaranteed. After reading the introduction, this one has a 5000 mAh battery, and the picture feels friendly. It's pretty good to use."
"The appearance is okay, but the box was a little ugly when I got it. Fortunately, there didn't seem to be any major problems after opening it. I believe it wasn't crushed! No major problems have been found so far, let’s try it first and see how it goes!"
It’s impossible not to change. The most disgusting thing about China Southern Airlines is that the in-flight meal is Mengniu yogurt@_C93
"Damn, it’s so annoying that the price has just been reduced after it’s just arrived! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"This is the food star of this week. Actually, I’m just happy because I have Mengniu Fruit Grains and DreamWorks Original Yogurt... But now I’m eating so much that I really want to vomit it up. QUQ"
It matches the actual description and is worth owning.
"I have been using it for half a month and there are basically no problems. I don’t play games, I just use it to watch TV and work. . . Not bad! ! !"
The mobile phone is really not that good
"Thank you to the beautiful host who lives a good life for sending me Mengniu coupons. Haha, you can also get prizes by watching TV, which is not bad."
"It always freezes, won't turn on, vibrates when pressing the power button, and the screen stays black. There are no other problems, but this problem is very annoying, and the customer service has not given a good solution."
"I have been using it for 3 months now, and there is ghosting on the screen. I don’t trust JD.com anymore, what kind of store is this? Poor poor. . . . Give 1 star in order to give this review before it can be published"
Received the goods. Haven't installed it yet. I don't know how the performance is yet..
"The second time I bought it, I made an oversight and bought a smaller one, but the item was very good."
"Mengniu is always bright, interesting and distinctive"
"Good reviews, call Honor Tablet T1-823L, China Mobile and China Unicom. Praise, create civilization, thank you for having me."
This sour yogurt is going to be hot~
Just got it yesterday and it feels good
"Say no to Mengniu and don’t subscribe to the morning news! Mengniu has permanently deleted BS from my purchase list. I will never drink Mengniu. I despise you. If you don’t drink Mengniu, you will die!"
"I bought it for my parents. It feels good. After trying it for the first time, I feel that the price/performance ratio is very good! ! praise"
This is my second purchase. I have always trusted JD.com’s self-operated products. The service is fast and the logistics is fast. I also hope that JD.com will bring us more and better products and resolutely put an end to fake and shoddy products. I support you. . .
"Crashes! Can't even turn off the phone! ! ! ! When playing the King of Glory card, you can click on the hero and run directly to the opposite side!"
"Junk Jingdong, 7-day no-reason returns, you guys are eating shit! 7 days of good-sounding rubbish for no reason"
"Oops, I won the championship in the Central League for the first time, and I felt so happy and happy, sweet and sour, this is the taste of Mengniu Sour Yogurt, it’s him, it’s this taste! ! !"
"A very disappointing shopping experience. The wf signal is very poor. In the same place, others have full access to my phone’s two slots, but others have two or three slots. I don’t have it."
"Well, it's not bad. I've already used it. It's OK for heating hot water. The price/performance ratio is pretty good."
"They say you’ll get a discount coupon after you purchase it! After I purchased it, I was told to refer to the page! No more! The credibility issue is really a headache!"
It’s been less than three months and I can’t turn it on. I’m going to apply for repair. The entire tablet feels too soft in my hand.
"The baby is very good, dad likes it very much, the speed is fast, the video can be watched clearly, the game does not freeze, and the phone does not get hot! ! Really super value for money! ! !"
The effect is not good and the Internet is very slow. I recommend buying a branded one next time.
"This is the worst mobile phone I have ever seen, bar none. I just bought it yesterday, and today I can’t even turn it on and it keeps repeating the startup screen. It’s not that Huawei is bad, but it’s JD.com’s fault. There are too many fakes. well"
"The delivery was really slow. I paid on the morning of the 1st and it was expected to arrive on the 2nd, but it didn't arrive until the afternoon of the 4th. It says that the memory is 32G but only 21G when turned on, and the leather case is not easy to use."
It’s very easy to use. I got a free case and film during the event.
"Dad likes it very much, genuine product"
I’m so angry that I can’t buy it online anymore since it’s a refurbished phone.
"Needless to say the logistics speed, the screen display effect is great, it is suitable for children, it should be enough, the aspect ratio feels a bit too large, but it is suitable for watching movies, other things should be OK"
This is my first time using JD.com and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Thank you!
"The resolution is high, 2k, and its sound effects are great. It also supports GPS positioning. It is very practical and has fast fingerprint unlocking sensitivity."
Mengniu can’t afford to be hurt! You can’t afford to be hurt by drinking Mengniu!
Very good and powerful
"This is an excessive product. It does not upgrade the system at all. Even older products have pushed new systems, but this one is not pushed! ! !"
"I’ve been using it for two months, it’s easy to use and smooth, and it’s an affordable purchase on Double Eleven."
Screen is not clear
"High definition, nice sound, fast speed, support domestic products"
The memory is too small. I want to return it but I don’t know. I can give it a refund.
I just received it and haven’t used it yet. I hope my son likes it. I have been using JD.com and the logistics speed is excellent.
The quality is very good. Huawei’s quality assurance is very good. I will buy Huawei phones again in the future! !
Usually the card cannot be used after buying a mobile phone! Sometimes it shuts down automatically.
"I bought it for the elderly at home to watch videos, and it won’t last long in a day. As a result, after using it for just over a month, the touch screen failed and there was no response when clicking. I returned it for repair, but the result was still the same. Very poor shopping experience."
Rubbish Huawei ruined my youth
I really like this ad. I also really like the Mengniu commercial. Chen Ou is so young and handsome. Did you come up with this advertisement by yourself?
"The express delivery is fast and the mobile phone is also good. Haha, my husband likes it very much! I will buy it next time!"
"Okay, okay, I bought it for my colleague. It’s my aunt’s birthday. I heard that she likes it very much and even gave her a membership so you can watch it. 666"
I’m writing a review today after using it. It’s a good phone and I like it very much.
"I feel safe shopping on JD.com, the goods arrive quickly and the price is affordable. It’s really great!"
"The packaging is very good, not as crappy as others."
"The battery drains out too quickly. When fully charged, the battery ran out after only 5 hours of chatting on WeChat."
"At this time, cutting cakes is a derogatory term. Do idiots like Mengniu think cutting cakes is high-end?"
"The photos are blurry, the resolution of the mobile phone is very low, and the video is not clear at all. It is really rubbish. I advise everyone not to buy it."
It took me a long time to think of the review. It’s cost-effective and great for watching TV shows. It would be nice if the battery life was a little better.
"Also: I like the courier here, 618 also delivered it on the same day. The goods are packaged completely."
"Place an order for lp, get points and leave. I won’t say whether it’s good or not first. Delivery to your door is fast, but in the future, there will be a trend of charging more!"
"Bought for my dad, looks flawless. Try it first"
"I bought it for so long, I just don’t want to say it, I don’t want to say it, I can’t swallow it anymore, the call volume is too low, sometimes the other party can’t hear what is being said, I always like the black screen, speechless, I will never do it again in the future Shopping"
The tablet is great. Friends who support Huawei Honor like it very much and trust JD.com.
Drinking Mengniu = chronic suicide
Please pay more attention to our Weibo and our changes in quality construction. We must both behave with conscience and do things with conscience. We look forward to making Mengniu beautiful from the outside to the inside!
Bought for the elderly to watch videos. The only difference between the mobile phone and the phone is the call function
"I hesitated between the American version of Samsung T817T and Huawei M3 for more than a month, and finally bought the M3. For learning use, it is very good and more valuable than T817T!"
"A great, very affordable tablet with very high resolution and very fast speed. ."
"Huawei's tablet is very easy to use, better than Apple's"
"In order to save trouble, I bought a shell film set, but the film turned out to be larger than the camera."
It’s really rubbish. I can’t use any wireless network. I can’t use the same network on Huawei x2. Why?
It broke in less than a month. It rebooted endlessly and couldn't be used. I sent it back to the factory and replaced the motherboard. The quality was rubbish. I was speechless.
"It looks okay, I don’t know what will happen in the future. If I use it well, I will buy it again in the future."
The 16g machine only has 10g. It takes up too much. The pixels are not very good and cannot be adjusted.
The membrane case package I bought obviously only gave me the bare metal. I saw a lot of people saying this in the comments. It’s a negative review.
"I bought a box of yogurt and when I went out I found it was Mengniu. After a closer look, I thought Brother Niu was so talented."
"Mengniu, awesome"
"It just doesn’t come with headphones. Other tablets require headphones as a gift, but Huawei’s doesn’t come with headphones."
The price is affordable and the big screen is great for watching movies. The most unexpected thing is that it saves electricity! ! !
The prizes for unit activities should be pretty good
"In fact, Mengniu is a very honest brand. It tells everyone straightforwardly that it ""just wants a little bit of happiness"", but what you want is ""a big piece of happiness"". Isn't this deliberately embarrassing Mengniu?"
I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law. The old lady is very energetic and makes video calls every day.
"The picture quality is not very clear, and they don’t even have headphones. Are they not even given the minimum standard? , I’m drunk too, the delivery is very fast, one star is for the delivery, the machine doesn’t matter, you just have to have what you should have."
"The camera is so bad, the photos taken are so bad"
"Overall, it's good to use and economical."
"Trash, the price dropped just a few days after I bought it"
"It feels good, the response is very fast, my son likes it very much"
It turns out that Mengniu has changed its packaging! So beautiful!
"In short, domestic products are doing very well, I support them."
"Overall it's okay, but the display isn't very good, the sound quality is really good, and the storage is too little."
"Bad review. My phone drains battery very quickly. I don’t want to give it a single star. If I don’t give it, I won’t be able to post it."
"I bought it for an old man. I held it for a while and didn’t let go. Especially the sound effect, it’s perfect! ! !"
Drink Mengniu if you are stupid
It is said that Mengniu has also passed the test.
"I couldn’t charge it after two days of use, and couldn’t make calls after returning it for repair."
"To boycott Japanese goods, why not boycott Mengniu first!"
"Damn it, I will never eat anything from Nestlé again~ I always have problems, just like Mengniu"
"The door-to-door delivery was great, I received it the next day."
"I haven’t used it yet, so I don’t know the situation, but JD.com’s products are trustworthy, so I’ll give you a good review first. . . . . ."
It’s not easy to use. Don’t buy it. The resolution is relatively low.
Kids love it! This price is very cost-effective!
Jingdong's service is really bad. what are you doing.
It's genuine. It's good to use and feels good.
The second part has a large screen and is durable. Huawei is really good.
"The pixels are too poor, especially the video is so blurry that you can’t see people clearly."
Mengniu’s milk has the most generous flavor
Very good. I placed the order at 11pm and it arrived before noon the next day.
Would Mengniu be unhappy if its own packaging was used by Lipton?
Please purchase with caution.
"It’s really J8’s trick and it’s okay not to give it away. The next day it was reduced by 200. Haha, what can I say?"
The system's automatic remote assistance app often fails to make calls because it does not have permission to access the microphone and needs to be restarted.
"3g RAM, smoothness is relatively good, other things don’t feel like much"
This is my second one. I feel very satisfied with it. It looks beautiful and is a trustworthy brand.
Mengniu is really awesome and domineering
"Ideal for watching TV. Downloaded Xiaobanlong. Can't play, stuck. No other problems have been encountered yet"
"The price I bought the day before yesterday was reduced by * yuan before it arrived today. In fact, * yuan is nothing, but I just feel awkward."
Drinking Mengniu again is pure stupidity
Dongdong likes to drink my Mengniu red date yogurt and wants to steal it from me. What should I do?
"After using it for a day, there is no fever and the clarity is good."
"Senior, you are so tall! The famous “national brand” is actually a foreign-invested enterprise registered in the Cayman Islands! ! Admire, admire! #Mengniu# #dairy product#"
"Boycott Sanlu, boycott Mengniu, boycott revision, boycott Jiuguijiu"
"I suspect it is a second-hand product. One is that it does not have a network access license, and the other is that it has a screen protector. I don’t know if this is the condition when it leaves the factory or if the previous buyer has a screen protector. Also, the gold color is too ugly."
"The price has dropped, who is still buying it?"
"Logistics fraud, everyone, be careful. The self-operated logistics part of Jingdong’s website claims that orders placed at 23:00 on the same day cannot be delivered the next day. Be careful when asking for a birthday gift the next day or an important time."
The merchants are very dishonest. They set up a promotion and sell the goods while stocks last. It is purely a matter of speculation and deceiving buyers. Whoever buys will be fooled.
"Not bad, not bad, fast delivery"
"The express delivery is fast, the product is very good, and I am very satisfied with the purchase."
It’s good. The express delivery is very fast. I bought it on the first morning and it arrived at noon the next day. It’s very good.
Mengniu big fruit! I decisively think of those days when I was struggling in my senior year of high school~
"Bad review, I wrote that there was a gift, but it was not delivered, and the customer service could not be contacted."
"In the afternoon, I tried another banana milk with a cute cow on it. It tastes better than yesterday's Bingge Rui. That one is too sweet. Oh my god, it feels weird. Mengniu's is the most expensive and the most deceptive @BB Infinite"
I gave it to my mother. She likes it very much. It’s very easy to use. The screen is big and suitable for my mother to use.
Suitable size and easy to carry
"What a piece of shit, if you have a problem you won’t be able to find anyone, so be it! So be it! If it doesn't work, forget it, it's too bad"
"Specialize in moving milk back to Xili. Forgive me for being too lazy to go to the coast recently, and forgive me for boycotting Mengniu Yili."
"Cheap but no good goods, rubbish"
Rubbish! #food??# Is Mengniu’s entire industrial chain completely out of control?
Drink Mengniu!
"After placing the order, the price has changed before I receive the goods. It’s so deceptive. The first shipment from Beijing was very disappointing."
"It doesn’t match the description, and the screen resolution is too poor. In short, it’s such a loss. I regret buying it. If it wasn’t for the Chinese New Year and I couldn’t return it, I would definitely return it."
I don’t know what’s going on with this phone. The signal is very poor. Sometimes I can’t receive calls at all.
It’s a fake. It’s only been a week and I can’t use voice input. The screen doesn’t work. Haha.
It’s really rubbish. It took 10 days to arrive. I asked customer service but they didn’t know anything.
How could Mengniu do this? ? ? ? Bah! Boycott Mengniu!
"I bought two, one is fine, but the other one is terrible. The screen is not working well. The customer service tried to solve every problem. It makes me very annoyed after playing the game!"
"The response is fast and the app runs smoothly. Overall I'm quite satisfied, but I'm not used to using this after using Apple."
"I have received the item, and it looks good. My son likes it very much, but it is a little stuck. The price/performance ratio is good, and it is enough for my son!"
Bought for a friend and said it was good
"What I received was a rip off, and the packaging was rotten. This means that if you want to return it, you have to spend 198 yuan to buy this **membership."
"Very good, very good!"
Mengniu said: Our company's milk is the best in the world. . .
"Not bad, good sound quality"
"What is the correct translation of ""Just for a little happiness""? Come and take a look at Mengniu!"
"The thing is very beautiful, it would be best if it had a cover."
The quality is too poor. The tempered film delivered does not match the model of the mobile phone.
Everything is fine. A sticker is included.
I’m not satisfied with my JD shopping this time. It’s difficult to get JD’s logistics. The delivery was delayed for two days and the logistics information is not updated. I have to call customer service every day. The current JD delivery time makes me suspicious.
"Not bad, worth buying"
"It sucks, the resolution is terrible, and charging is extremely slow."
"I bought one for my dad at the end of last year and I am quite satisfied with it. Now I bought another one for my daughter to learn English. My family’s mobile phones have also been replaced by Honor one after another, and domestic products are getting better and better."
"Satisfied with the purchase, the express delivery is the highlight, very fast. The attitude is also very good. Thanks"
The battery is not good and it runs out of power very quickly when in standby mode. Definitely a bad review.
"Bought this for my dad, it works well and he is very satisfied."
The quality is too bad
Poor 'poor sound quality' 'has echoes and rustling' 'camera pixels are very low after using it for a month' 'photography function is equal to 0' not as clear as the phone I got with a 200 phone charge.
"Logistics and service are too poor. I bought it on the 11th, and the free gift on the 18th has not been shipped yet, so it is still far away. JD.com is not far from bankruptcy."
"The product is good, just as expected."
It's great to buy and use at home. Bought this for my parents and am very happy with it.
"Too bad, too bad"
Reconciliation as before! Where are you! You are
"The express delivery was very good. When the goods arrived, someone else signed for them. They called me specifically to tell me that the goods had arrived. Thank you."
"1L Mengniu, so luxurious"
"After using it for two days, the machine is very laggy, charging is very slow, and power consumption is very fast."
"I just bought a new mobile phone during the Chinese New Year. Now it is fully charged in the morning. I haven’t played games and haven’t used it much. At noon, the battery has dropped below 10% and it has shut down. There is something wrong with the quality. Please buy with caution!"
"Get it in hand and try it out immediately, the system is smooth"
"Liuliu, I'm here to help you protect your rights again. Mengniu's high-calcium milk continues to deteriorate, claiming that the staff are negligent."
"Second purchase, I think it’s okay"
"Not bad, the speed is quite fast."
"I like giving Mengniu yogurt as a gift, hahaha"
How can I love domestic products? The screen is dull and motionless. Even Xunlei Kankan cannot be opened. The interface of Xunlei Kankan is the same as a crash. I haven't opened a movie yet until yesterday.
Good review! ! ! The express delivery is really fast! ! ! ! Not used yet! ! ! It should be useful! ! !
It is not easy for domestic brands to do this. It’s worth buying and useful for Chinese people!
"Delivery takes 2-6 days. It has to be shipped on the sixth day, and it doesn't arrive until the seventh day. It's obvious that the goods are in stock but not shipped. The speed of self-operated products must be criticized."
"It’s a very nice toy, I don’t know how it will turn out in photos!"
Why are there no headphones? I didn’t buy them when I had them.
The price-performance ratio of this tablet is quite good. There is no problem in general use. The workmanship is very exquisite. The touch and clarity are satisfactory. The power is durable.
"Not bad, hahahahahahahaha, good, good, good, good"
"It's a cool word, but it's a pity that there is no matching leather case for sale."
Not bad. It’s a gift for a friend’s child. It’s very good.
"After only a few days of use, the screen was broken. What a quality, I would never buy it again. I doubt whether it is genuine."
"The stuff is good, the system is quite clean, there is no need to install other management software, the screen is the most enjoyable, big enough, fast, and there have been no crashes so far."
"You are really a loser, I have been buying things from you, and you give me something like this, and I don’t buy things from you anymore. That’s it, who dares to buy it."
"The screen is too fragile. I only bought it two days ago. I put it on the bed and accidentally pressed it, and the inner screen broke. The previous Samsung tablet was fine even if I dropped the screen. I spent 400 to go to Huawei customer service to replace the inner screen."
"They don’t even give me a sticker, the buyer is a bit stingy."
"Used for company, but looks good"
"Very good, very good, very good, recommended to buy"
"Not good, the screen picture is not clear and the sound quality is poor. etc. All in all, it’s bad."
"The tablet is great, great for watching videos and listening to music! It is indeed the ace among tablets! Express delivery, I received the tablet in less than a day, thank you to the merchant! Thank you Jingdong! May Jingdong go to the world!"
No need to say anything. I’m so disappointed. How can I give something that has been used to others?
Very easy to use. I really like it. The price is not expensive either.
The pixels of the product are too inferior. The 5 million pixels are not as good as the original one. It was a very unpleasant purchase.
"If it weren't for the lowest star, I would never give it to you. It's a broken phone and a bunch of stuck."
Mengniu is so crowded...
"I finally understand why I hate these two novices so much. This one is an expert and has great connotations, haha. I grew up drinking Mengniu and Yili."
"The tablet is easy to use, videos are clear to watch, and the battery can be used for a long time when fully charged."
"This one is not good. I played with the Honor of Kings card for half a day. It has little memory and is not worth the price. If you want to return it, JD.com’s customer service will ignore you. Alas."
"Nothing was given. The quality is average, and the battery ran out while watching a movie!"
"The machine is okay. Just the tempered film, leather case, and earphones are not included. There is only one charger. The packaging box is too big. Things inside were shaking back and forth. Bad review."
"At first, I thought it was because the old man couldn't use random sounds, vibrations, and silent three-state switching. Later I found out that it was a system problem."
"Sending it to a friend, I placed the order last night and received it early this morning! Jingdong's logistics 120?, it should be genuine."
"I like the tablet, it’s easy to use. The gifts are practical and the logistics are awesome. A happy shopping. OK OK."
"The logistics speed is very fast, and it is good to use."
"The workmanship is good and it feels good in the hand. The sound quality is really good, both externally and externally. The screen is very clear, and the eye protection mode also protects your eyes. Domestic products, support Huawei."
Not bad. Very useful. I like it.
The charging port is extremely difficult to plug in... I have to try for a long time every time... and it breaks when I plug it in. I'm really convinced... the workmanship...
"Two days passed like this. . . . Starting to look forward to next week's arrival. . . . The banana milk highly recommended by my colleagues is okay, but I am still relatively rare about Mengniu’s banana milk."
"After two days of trial use, the overall performance is good. The core performance is better than that of mtk x20. There is a difference from the test score. It may be that Huawei's system optimization is more powerful. The screen display effect is good, and it is very good to use as a learning machine for children."
"This is my first time buying from Huawei. I originally wanted to support domestic products, but I was unlucky and encountered a ""defective product""?"
"I just bought it yesterday, today the price is reduced and I get a free set and film."
"No big deal, the phone crashed two days after I bought it. I asked for an exchange but the product was not exchanged. Second-hand customer service."
"Grandma's, the price was reduced as soon as I bought it"
"Very good board. Whether it's performance or anything else, support domestic products and support Huawei!"
"Bad review, bad review! ! ! ! ! It was 949 in the morning and 899 in the afternoon, which was very unpleasant."
"Got the tablet. It feels much better than the previous generation. Just for the anniversary, the express delivery was three days slow. Support Huawei and hope to do better and better. ! ! ! !"
The resolution is too bad...
Master Kong’s classic milk tea and Mengniu’s walnut-flavored breakfast milk are so delicious
"This is my second purchase, the brand is good and the store service is also good!"
"Drink Mengniu and brainwash your intestines! Drink Mengniu and become a Chinese with a correct outlook on life and a complete personality! Boycotting Mengniu is the right thing! Don't buy it! Go to hell with Mengniu. Go to hell with Mengniu. Poison to death, one or the other? !"
"Normally, if I had known earlier I would have bought Apple, the difference would have been only 600 yuan. I regret it."
"Mengniu is mighty, bright and domineering. Anyone who drinks domestic milk is a hero."
The company purchases gifts quickly. . . . JD.com’s services are trustworthy. . . The quality is very good. . . Jingdong express next day delivery
"There was a membrane and a shell in the order, but the goods came without them. I’m not happy..."
Bought for my kids...! Kids love it.
"What are the criteria for an outstanding enterprise? Three powers: influence, which can become a flag; vitality, which can withstand the test of death; contribution, which can bring happiness to people. Chairman of the Board of Directors of China Mengniu"
I have to leave a negative review. I don’t want to give it a star. I bought it for a colleague. The store is a big bully. None of the three promised gifts are available. I contacted customer service and refused to acknowledge it. I have called 12315 to complain. I hope anyone with screenshots of the gifts can contact me. .
"Yes, it's genuine, except for the big black border, everything is fine. ."
"Reply Mengniu responded quickly. . . But I am a slow reactioner, so I still dare not drink. . . . New Mengniu New Changes http:t.cn/zlwIFKA I don’t understand this theory. Anyway, I don’t dare to drink Mengniu because I recognize the brand but not the packaging."
Mengniu Guanyi Milk enhances immunity. @???
I haven’t drank Mengniu for a long time......
"There must be too many events. I placed an order two days ago and it was said to be a 618 event. Today, the price has been reduced again before 618 arrived. What do you mean? Could it be that what I saw last time was a fake 618 event. 1 point for the tablet, it works well."
"I bought it for a colleague, who said it was pretty good."
"The delivery speed is very fast, the service attitude is super good, the price/performance ratio is very good, and it is worth buying!"
Resolutely resist the garbage Mengniu
I haven’t installed it yet. I’ll review it after I install it.
I discovered that Mengniu’s new milk is very good. The above sentence says romance begins when we meet.
I used #?checkQR code to compare prices# and found that the price of the Mengniu Guanyi Milk fermented milk (coconut kernels) I bought was accurate.
"OK, good value for money"
"No, there is nothing. The money is more expensive than elsewhere but there is nothing."
Why can’t I customize the label if it’s not a good review? The color of my screen display is too light. I have to restore it to factory settings to get it normal. I’m applying for a return.
I went to Jingdong in ** and it was gone within two days after I bought it. Trash
"The effect of using it now is good, there is no big problem, Huawei has always been good"
"The new mobile phone can’t even be charged. What a big deal, it’s so complicated. It’s so bad."
"What the heck, it’s just $2 off as soon as it arrives. I’m really speechless."
I am still using it. The sound quality is quite good. It is your best choice for playing games and watching movies.
"There are many singers singing in front of mr’s birthday celebration song skewering T T I’m sorry that your Mengniu Sour Yoghurt champion is so awesome... My family will only win a Grammy!! Can’t compare, can’t compare, it’s true Posted by your family"
Unscrupulous merchants will not issue paper invoices after sales.
A very failed purchase from JD.com. I bought a tablet and got a free gift right away. The price dropped just a few days after I bought the USB flash drive last time. This is hurting your customers. I will definitely not buy from JD.com next time.
"The resolution is too poor, I might as well buy an iPad and be depressed."
This was taken when I just bought it. Now it’s so stuck that I don’t want to use it anymore and it’s broken. I suggest you don’t buy it and don’t be deceived.
"When I bought it, it was priced at 1.8.8.8, but it dropped to 1.6.9.9 in just 8 days. There is a 7-day price guarantee. For this reason, I have a negative review."
"First of all, JD Logistics exceeds this, which is the main reason for choosing JD."
"Ordinary, just a mobile phone and charger? Don’t new mobile phone manufacturers wear headphones? If you really want to return it, if you feel it's troublesome, use it for a few days before considering whether to return it or not."
"It takes an hour to update the system after I get it back, which is very troublesome."
"After using it for three days, I feel pretty good!"
I have stopped buying Mengniu for a long time.
Bought for an old man! The old man likes it very much! Very easy to operate! A phone card was also given! Merchants are interested!
"There is no cushioning material, just a cardboard box. I am very dissatisfied. When I buy Huawei products in the future, I would rather go to its official website. Even if I buy earplugs on the official website, they are all covered. Jingdong has nothing and I am still drunk."
"Rubbish products, rubbish mobile phones, I want to be dirty, I want to greet your whole family"
"The logistics is very fast, not bad. I always use Huawei mobile phones. Support domestic production"
The tablet is great! Watching TV is very exciting! A satisfying purchase
Drinking Mengniu Yili = suicide! Complain decisively... Complain!
"It’s a tablet that can make calls. It’s very fast. It’s fun to watch videos. It looks beautiful and supports domestic products. It’s just a little inconvenient to carry around when going out, so it’s suitable for use at home."
"It's a broken thing. Can someone with slow reaction time play it? There is only a charger inside, nothing comes as a gift, and the pixels are terrible!"
"Bad review, no earplugs included."
Mengniu tastes really bad!
"Yes, the after-sales service is very good. I always trust JD.com"
"Needless to say, after using it for a while, I can evaluate it. The shooting effect is very good. The only drawback is that it cannot be upgraded to Huawei's latest system."
"It’s so fake. The touch screen failed just a month after I bought it. Is it so deceptive? They also asked me to send it back for repair, and it would take a month. Do you want me to not use my phone for a month? It’s so funny. I’m really getting more and more disappointed with JD.com."
"Haha, this is my first time using Huawei. I just want to say, it’s rubbish. It’s rubbish. I’m sorry I took it back and haven’t used it yet. I feel very unhappy."
"The price dropped a week after I bought it, so I received a bad review."
The goods are not very good and the logistics is too slow.
"Not bad, although it can't be compared with Apple, and it can't be compared with anything at this price. It's very good for the same price."
The baby has been received. The delivery is fast. The product is in good condition. It has not been used yet. It is a leather case and does not have a tempered film. It is a bit troublesome to buy it yourself!
"I have been using it for a while before commenting. It performs well in all aspects. I bought it just for playing games, and it provides all aspects of gaming experience. The only drawback is that the system takes up 9 G of memory."
"The product is very good, logistics and delivery are fast"
Express delivery is pretty fast
I suspect it is second-hand. There are fingerprints on the screen. I bought it on January 7th and took delivery. There is a screenshot from November 7th in the camera album.
Authentic
"? You said it once! Because in the second half of this year, it is possible that I will"
Anyone who drinks Mengniu will be mentally retarded
I bought it yesterday and received it at noon today. The speed is really fast and the tablet is very smooth to use.
Supplements ~ cleaning ~ Mengniu ~ BMW ~ (should be that much...)
"I thought it was capable of making calls, but it turned out not to be the case, and the price was reduced just a few days after I bought it?? I was also drunk."
My favorite Mengniu pudding
I bought it for a friend and he said he was very satisfied with it.
"It's much cheaper to buy during the shopping festival, the screen size is moderate, it's easy to carry for office use, the speed is good, and the storage capacity can be expanded."
"The stuff is very good, my family members all use it and say it is good."
"Damn it, if you don’t drink Mengniu from now on, why didn’t Yili detect it?"
"BS, I will definitely not drink Mengniu. I despise you. If you don’t drink Mengniu, you will die!"
"I hope Mengniu can give Chinese people a cup of healthy milk. Mengniu welcomes you, and I hope more netizens can come to Mengniu and learn about Mengniu."
Suddenly I feel a little embarrassed... Reply You're welcome…………………………………………………………………………………… Thank you for your support of Mengniu products.
"Looking at the reviews, many of them came with earplugs and a selfie stick, but who knew they didn’t get either, so disappointed?"
"The report was released by the Non-Express Hotel Alliance. I have another conspiracy theory! In fact, these cannot be generalized. Mengniu has won awards in Hong Kong! !"
"I can’t explain why the newly-arrived flat screen that has just been disassembled has glue and scratches on it, but I can’t take a photo to clearly capture the scratches, so I have to admit it’s a failure?"
"It's okay, it's good for the elderly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
"After using it for two or three days, it often crashes and restarts. I’m sincere. I don’t know if it’s a refurbished one. I thought Jingdong was very reliable, but it turned out like this."
"Huawei is still trustworthy and meets general needs, including simple stand-alone games."
I just received it today. The whole machine is bent. I don’t know if the tempered film can be attached. I have to go on a business trip these days and don’t have time to replace it. Somewhat disappointed.
"Forget it, Mengniu, it’s not worth risking your life."
"Not bad, very smooth, especially the courier service is great, I like it"
"Bought for the elderly, suitable size"
"not bad. Compared with Apple, the battery doesn’t last long and gets hot easily."
"Don't buy it, it's not easy to use, and it's very stuck when you buy it. The most important thing is that it's very troublesome to apply for a return. The customer service is all deceptive and they won't refund the money on purpose. All in all, bad, bad, bad. The most speechless online shopping experience."
"The price was reduced by 200 yuan just one week after buying it, and the price protection is not supported. I am so speechless."
"Very good baby, very satisfied, logistics is fast. It's a pity that there is no headphone cable."
"Not satisfied. It was 877 yuan before the 15th, 899 yuan on the 16th and 17th, 849 yuan on the 18th, 899 yuan on the 19th, and 848 yuan on the 20th (today). I bought it on the 17th for 899 yuan. Please give me back 50 yuan. Thank you. !"
"I bought the goose egg for 1860 yuan, and it came with a leather case, a tempered film, and a LeTV membership card. Then there is the packaging, which is the packaging of the brand store. There is no protection. This aspect of the packaging needs to be improved."
I have always bought Huawei products. I am very satisfied with this tablet. I like it very much.
"Environmentally friendly packaging tubes. . . It's useless, as long as I see the word ""Mengniu"" I won't buy it..."
"The machine is still very smooth to use, and the sound quality is good."
"The gift is too little, the camera has low pixels"
"When I first got it, the merchant carefully used a big box just to hold such a small board."
Express delivery is not good
WeChat is stuck after two days of use... Speechless
The mobile phone screen is big and the logistics is fast.
"Very good. Upgraded to emui4.0 directly after arrival. I have been using Huawei, very good! !"
Very good. This one is for my mother’s house.
The image is indeed not as clear as the phone. But the effect of listening to music and watching videos is still better than that of mobile phones. Easier to carry than a computer!
"It feels okay, it's pretty smooth, and the battery hasn't been completely released yet, so I don't know how it will be for the time being."
It's very big and you can also make phone calls. . . . . . .
"Bought for my parents, very good, very satisfied!"
"The tablet has a bit of a lag, which is not good."
"Support domestic production, support Huawei! Very useful, beyond expectation! The screen color is great!"
"The memory is simply not enough, only 10 G, and the performance is not very good! It’s hard to see when taking photos at night·"
Mengniu! You are awesome! How dare you scream in the face of spoiled milk and maggots?
"I have been paying attention to it for a long time, and I took advantage of the shopping festival to get it quickly. It runs smoothly. The only thing is that it is a bit regretful that it only has 8 million pixels."
"Can't make phone calls, that's okay. Not fast. The sound quality is okay, enough for the elderly to watch TV. Trust the Huawei brand"
"This is the first time I buy digital products on JD.com. The logistics is fast, the items are good, and the packaging is simple and generous. I am very satisfied. In addition, my Weibo: Bring me, senior brother, and those who use Huawei tablets can communicate together. ?"
"Fast logistics. The stuff is super useful. Great gaming experience. The feeling of holding it with one hand is much better than that of iPad, but the color fineness is not as fine as that of iPad."
"Very good, delivery is fast, I will buy home appliances from JD.com in the future"
"If you want to curse, block it!"
I can’t install software without downloading from Huawei App Store. It’s disgusting. It’s disgusting. I can’t decide what I spend money on.
"A very cost-effective tablet with clear images, bright colors and pleasant sound."
Jingdong is okay! That courier even saved two cents every time he delivered a package and didn’t make any phone calls! Just leave your stuff and leave! Extremely irresponsible!
The speed is very fast and the volume is loud. This is very important for watching videos.
Configuration cost-effective
"This is the second time I bought it for a friend. Although it didn’t cost a few yuan less, the friend still liked the cost-effective fruit. The key is that you can insert a card and don’t have to pay hundreds of yuan more like fruit."
The screen clarity is not high and the running speed is extremely slow
"I’m used to everything on JD.com, but I don’t know if it’s cheap or not, it’s convenient, and it’s good to have door-to-door delivery and after-sales service, haha, that’s enough."
"No headphones, no headphones, no headphones, say important things three times"
"Today, I will drink Mengniu for my Miaomiao. Grow my baby quickly."
"The battery is not durable and the battery capacity is reduced by more than 10% after being left for one night, which is not satisfactory."
"The battery of my mobile phone is very hot right after I use it. I try it first, but I am a little worried about it."
"Everything is good, but it was not delivered that night."
"What? It was in stock when I bought it, but after I paid, I was told it was out of stock. It took almost 10 days for the product to be shipped. It’s too bad."
The system is faster than I expected. It is very good and cost-effective. It is enough for the elderly.
"I came here for this Huawei brand, but I was very disappointed. After using it for only a month, it stopped working. Is it really authentic? I am very doubtful. Maybe Huawei technology is based on bragging. Anyway, I will not buy this in the future. Brand"
"I bought this tablet with the mentality of supporting domestic products, which is quite good. Huawei is indeed the pride of our country's private enterprises."
"After using it for a few days, I feel that this machine has quality problems."
"I haven’t used it yet, but my family said it looks good, so I’ll give it a good review first!"
"I don’t drink a drop, I only drink Guangming. I don’t drink even if I’m on the system. I never drink the Mengniu that’s distributed on the plane. I won’t go either, even though they don’t want me. Ha? Inner Mongolia. ."
It’s too bad that you can’t buy mobile phones online. It’s a copycat version. I bought it twice and it didn’t work. I didn’t expect that Huawei’s mobile phones are like this too. Don’t be fooled.
"The customer service is terrible, this activity is a scam, and as expected, there are no good products online. Please be careful when purchasing."
This is the first time I bought electrical appliances without an invoice and I bought them from the official website. Bad review.
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it, and it didn't come with a screen protector. When I played, the screen went black and I couldn't turn it on for more than ten minutes. Not very satisfied."
"What I drink is Mengniu high calcium milk, woo woo woo woo"
Why didn't it come with a protective cover? It's so tiring to hold it. ?
"The pixels are so poor, and they didn’t even give me a protective case. What a scam."
"This resolution really pisses me off. If you only use it to watch videos, you can buy it. If you use it to watch e-books, you can skip it. It will be uncomfortable for your eyes after watching it for a long time."
It’s also great to get a tempered film when you buy a set! The quality is very good.
It cannot be used as a mobile phone to make calls. It has all the functions of other mobile phones. It is very easy to use and my daughter likes it very much!
Domineering gate. . . Mengniu in the video is domineering again!
You can also buy it for your dad. It’s so tall that you have to bring it with you when sweeping the floor every day to listen to music. The sound quality is good!
"Cheap, big, I regret it a bit, I would have bought another one if I had known"
"There are also ad breaks from Mengniu, which makes me angry just looking at them. What kind of Japanese goods are you boycotting? You can't even boycott Mengniu, a thing that is harmful to people, so why are you boycotting Japanese goods?"
"Speechless, the screen got a little broken for no reason, but otherwise it's fine."
"Well, the workmanship is perfect. It comes with some built-in programs, which I don’t like a bit. The rest are pretty good. The main Honor of Kings runs perfectly."
Extremely bad
The stuff is okay but delivered quickly
Just got it! Take some time to post again! The only thing is that the sound is too low
"I didn’t even give up the leather case as a gift, it was too embarrassing. Jingdong also gives away memberships,"
"Then, the workmanship of the camera is too rough, and the resolution is particularly poor. It is not as good as a 300-400 machine, and it makes your eyes uncomfortable after using it for a while."
"Not bad, love it"
This mobile phone is similar to a model phone and is a parallel import.
"I have a Huawei phone, and after using it for 3 days, the receiver went silent."
"The black edges are relatively large, but other aspects are fine, and the power consumption is well controlled."
"Damn, I really saw the legendary god. It’s so disgusting. I will boycott Mengniu from now on."
What rubbish.
"The quality is average, it is in use, it will take some time to evaluate"
"The customer service of Huani is not very good. The answers are completely off-topic and disgusting. I didn’t see it on my phone, so I don’t know the details."
"Very dissatisfied with shipping and delivery speed. Sent EMS, very dissatisfied. Domestic mainstream express delivery does not deliver, so why send EMS? I am speechless."
Nice birthday gift for dad
The incomplete guarantee is made. . People who don’t know the truth don’t express their opinions. . Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu
"I bought it for my dad, but the sound is so low that he can’t even hear it. It’s twice as loud as the normal Huawei sound. It’s a fake."
I feel so comfortable after taking a shower...eat an orange first and then a box of Mengniu puree...
"The wifi doesn't work, the connection + SMS authentication still doesn't work, I don't recommend buying it, I regret it. I'll give you the 900 you want."
"It’s so stuck, you really get what you pay for. Huawei is a piece of shit. . . The pre-installed software alone fills up the running memory and causes lags."
"I have been using Huawei products, and their performance is excellent. There is no pressure on the king or anything else, and the sound effects are also great. However, as netizens said, there is a black smear on the screen. . But it does not affect normal use. ."
It turns out that Baobao also likes Mengniu more than Yili.
"The effect is good, my wife likes her very much, no ghosting"
"Not great, not very good"
I’ve stopped drinking Mengniu for a long time.
"Can’t JD’s packaging be optimized? You don't have to put anything in such a big box, and you're not afraid of the tablet breaking?"
"Not good, slow to respond, no protective film included, poor packaging"
Used it before and it was good
"I haven’t tried it, so I’ll give it a try."
The size of the phone is perfect and the sound effect is great!
"The resolution is super low... and with such a big screen, I don’t know where the high-end specs are. I really don’t recommend buying it!"
The quality is very poor and it keeps restarting.
I bought a tablet for an old man. He likes it very much. I have always liked the Huawei tablet. It is a big brand and is good.
Bought for the elderly. The screen is very clear and the size is good. Huawei's system is trustworthy.
Why no invoice? I bought it for my colleague and it's working fine so far. .
"It's obviously an Android tablet, but it gives me an iPad-like experience. Whether it’s the interface or fluency, it’s absolutely top-notch."
"Use it to watch news, movies and TV series."
"KFC is cleaner than others, just like firmly believing that Mengniu is cleaner than Yili."
"Forget it if there is no clip, and forget it if there is no membrane either! The sound quality is also rubbish!"
"If Mengniu is not eliminated, the Chinese people will not be strong."
The delivery speed is quite fast. It’s pretty good after trying it out. It just doesn’t come with anything. It doesn’t include headphones or tempered film. It would be better if it comes with it.
"Although I waited a few days, I was still very satisfied!"
"I can only say that you get what you pay for. Overall it’s okay. It doesn’t feel like a tablet, just an enlarged version of a mobile phone."
"The resolution is extremely poor. They promised to return the product within seven days and exchange it within fifteen days. When I asked for an exchange, I explained that I wanted to exchange it for the same model!"
The tablet is very good and I am very satisfied with it. The resolution is also quite high and relatively clear. Shipping was fast and arrived quickly.
It is being used and there are no problems so far. I hope to keep it going.
"The font is too small, and the font on the web page cannot be adjusted. I bought it for an elderly person. I made a mistake. The earphones don’t work when I plug them in. I asked customer service, but they didn’t reply. It’s not good."
The screen is big enough and the effect is good!
"It’s raining heavily, but the courier guy is still doing it rain or shine, and the items are beautiful. JD.com is still as trustworthy as ever."
"Huawei is an absolute bad review! Representatives of Chinese enterprises, the price will be a bit confusing by then. Yesterday*, I bought it today*, what the hell! Bad review"
"Bad reviews, bad reviews, mainly for the price, the price was reduced as soon as I bought it*"
"It works fine, it runs faster. Not very good at taking pictures"
"As for the invoice, why don’t you give it if you don’t want it? Tax evasion?"
"Bought for my dad. He likes it very much, so he should give it as a gift, right?"
"Just one month after buying it, the price was reduced by 200 yuan! The headphone jack is still thick and it turns out that several headphones cannot be used! ! !"
Mengniu is really awesome
"The power bank I received was useless after just one use, it was rubbish, and the tablet was so-so."
"The delivery speed is super fast,"
"The apology statement is well said. This is the attitude that a large country enterprise should have. The foundation of China's dairy industry is still weak, and national enterprises cannot be blamed for being too demanding. Support Mengniu!"
"A surprising tablet, hundreds of dollars cheaper than in a physical store! It’s great for taking photos and watching videos. If you buy a Huawei membership for half a year at Huawei’s promotion price of 20 yuan, you can watch a lot of movies and TV series!"
"I like the tablet very much. It is very convenient for watching movies and TV. My dad likes it very much. Very good value for money. Like, like, like, like, like?"
"The tablet is very good, and the sound effect of the headphones is still great, but it needs the promotional video that comes with it to reflect it."
The stuff is pretty good and feels good.
"It is recommended that you don't buy it. The quality is relatively poor, the maintenance cost is too high, and the accessories are more expensive than the machine."
"I will never eat anything from Mengniu again. Boycotting Mengniu everything, selling expired products with different dates, and finding stones in fruit yogurt. Why are you so heartless?"
"This is a junk fighter, I advise you not to buy it. From my personal experience, this tablet cannot play games at all, and the picture quality is super rubbish."
I haven’t bought Mengniu for a long time.
Support Mengniu as always.
The one I bought is not good. It always restarts automatically. I don’t know what other people think.
I have stopped drinking Mengniu for a long time.
"Very good product, JD.com is trustworthy"
I'm waiting for the repair results! Thank you Huawei for letting me get to know domestically produced machines. I will probably never buy domestically produced machines again in the future.
"Yes, the screen is big, my aunt likes it very much"
"When I first got it, the big screen was still impressive. Fluency is also good and cost-effective"
"It feels good to use, but after using it for a while, I feel that the memory is still a bit small."
"Ultra-thin, convenient, high quality and low price, you can watch TV, movies and play games without any lag."
"Sometimes it gets stuck, but I don’t know if it’s a network card or a tablet card. Sometimes it takes a while to open WeChat. I'm using it to burn my newly purchased headphones."
It’s okay. I bought it during an event. The price is very good. I haven’t started using it yet. I will continue to comment after using it.
"How disgusting! ! I stopped drinking from Mengniu a long time ago. Don’t stop me! Let me spit out the Terensu I drank the year before last! Good milk made by Mengniu, nutritious and high in protein"
"The speed is fast, and the film is delivered in one flight. Fast, fast, enough for the elderly to watch movies"
"# boycottmengniu# Changing skins is useless, boycott it resolutely!"
"The quality is good, it would be nice if the screen was wider, like a big phone"
Too stuck. It's so stuck.
"It's just average. It's a decent purchase at this price. He's getting more and more products from Huawei now, and he's getting more and more appointments."
"The phone is a second-hand product. I really don’t know what to say. As soon as I saw the cover, I knew it had been dismantled and returned. Jingdong, you are enough."
Very dissatisfied
"Bad review! As the largest online e-commerce company in China, JD.com charges 949 for the same product during the day and 899 at night every day. It does not provide price protection and is suspected of defrauding consumers."
"Very bad, the four corners turned red as soon as I got it back. Then I communicated with the customer service. The senior customer service was very poor. When I asked what the solution was, he couldn’t tell me. 123."
"Calling all friends who want to commit suicide! Please look for the Mengniu trademark! It can be called the modern version of ""arsenic"", beware of counterfeits! The effect is visible!"
It's okay. The experience of a large-screen mobile phone is nothing special. It's still ok for studying.
"Anyway, I won’t drink Mengniu Yili anymore. Reply I don’t think I have failed. As long as one person is influenced by me to boycott it, it will be considered a success."
"The shipping speed is quite fast, and the delivery is also fast. The stuff is pretty good, the only drawback is that there is no bag"
"Don’t buy rubbish. If you want to buy something, buy a bottle of regret medicine first??"
The garbage will break down in less than a month.
"No, I thought they also gave earphones as a gift. They gave it to a fixed area. The gift list didn’t mention a fixed area. That’s not good."
I have always wanted to buy a domestic tablet. I have been looking for it for a long time and have chosen the Honor Play Tablet 2. I bought the 9.6-inch large screen and it looks really good. The configuration is completely sufficient! The split screen feature is especially appreciated!
JD.com has fast logistics and the product quality is good. I have been using it for a few days. I bought it for an elderly person and it is very good!
The battery is too weak and runs out of power within a day. A bad purchase.
"The black borders are too big, the processor is not very good, and there are some lags. The important thing is that I didn’t think it was worth the price, so I bought it at the event price. How much does P8MAX sell for now? It should be less than a thousand yuan"
"The interface is exactly the same as that of a mobile phone. The response is relatively fast. The price is affordable. The first choice for Android tablets. If you are patriotic, please support the Chinese brand. Patriotism starts with me."
I bought it for a friend and he is very satisfied with this tablet.
"It has been very useful from October 2016 to January 2017, and it always scores 5 points. Feel safe shopping on JD.com."
very good! Fast delivery! Good attitude! The machine looks good and is easy to use!
It’s really not that good. I definitely wouldn’t buy it in a physical store.
Mengniu is good. Where’s the rice?
It's rubbish. I can't download anything right after I got it. The computer freezes constantly.
"Logistics was fast, I received it that afternoon. The response is very fast, very light, very thin, and it is a top quality product made in China."
Sanyuan’s kefir is not as tasty as Mengniu’s. . Still support Mengniu
"The screen is big, very good, very affordable, very good"
The response is slow. It takes about ten seconds to open Tencent Video. The SD card cannot be cached. One star for express delivery.
"Although I am not very interested in this, I still have to sigh when I see such a clean and automated Mengniu workshop. The national dairy industry needs your strict control, innovation and prosperity."
"The product is OK, but the promised memory card was not delivered. a fly in the ointment"
It is hoped that Mengniu can provide better and better milk to the Chinese people.
"It's really bad. I was originally looking for a phone to make calls, but the phone card didn't work after I installed it."
"After I bought it, well, it was very big and the battery was very useful after playing with it for a long time. You can still use it and check it out in two days. I believe Huawei will not let me down."
"No matter what, I have to give a bad review."
A gift for my mother-in-law. I bought it for a long time and didn’t have time to review it. I feel good after using it for so long. It’s great.
"Okay, I'm very satisfied"
"I have been using it for a few days and it feels pretty good. I use it a lot to play games. Compared with the Huawei 9.6-inch tablet I bought before, this one is more likely to heat up, but it's acceptable."
"Before placing the order, I consulted customer service and said it would arrive the next day, but it took four days to arrive. I didn’t expect that JD.com would also cheat."
"The delivery was very fast, very good, they are all books I like, and activities are cheap!"
"I hope to donate US$30,000 in supplies, preferably Mengniu milk."
"The phone responds very slowly and the new battery needs to be charged twice a day. It's probably a refurbished phone. I've used so many new phones, so it's impossible for a new phone to be like this."
"I received the tablet and I was very unhappy. The packaging was smashed like this. There was just a packaging box inside the box with no padding at all. Fortunately, the tablet was not broken."
"The battery is so rubbish, it can’t even last a day on standby when fully charged, and customer service still won’t fix it."
"Those who are obstructing the country, if you don’t even understand Mengniu, how can you boycott Japanese goods?"
#??share# Mengniu made a mistake when it changed its advertising slogan for the first time in 13 years? Mengniu changed its advertising slogan for the first time in 13 years and made a mistake? --- http:t.cn/zlW19ri @mark
"I just used it for a month and it crashed when playing ordinary WeChat, let alone playing other games. I don’t know why, it’s because Huawei’s machine doesn’t work, or it’s just the one you sell. . . . ."
The electrical panel is not durable and cannot be clearly seen in photos. You will only know after using it for a while.
very nice. . . . . . Very good tablet
The merchant’s after-sales service attitude is good
"The matching screen protector was leaking, and the customer service I contacted was invisible. I was heartbroken, bad review, bad review, bad review, bad review, bad review, bad review."
This is the first time I buy something on JD.com. The logistics is really fast. I placed the order at 8:30 in the morning and it arrived at 5:00 in the afternoon. The product is also very good.
"It's a very good tablet for Android. The system is open, the smoothness is no worse than iOS, and the sound effect is good."
Very good items worth buying
"I bought it for my dad. It’s very good for him to watch videos. The characters are large and clear, and the video feels good. It’s worth owning."
"I've been weeding for a long time, but I finally pulled it out today. The stuff is good, and it supports domestic products. Huawei's products are now very powerful."
The external speaker broke within less than a month after I bought it.
"The appearance is very good, but the running speed is very slow. I originally bought such a big mobile phone because I just wanted to log in to Qianniu or Wangwang outside without being in front of the computer, but it was very slow! It’s just that overall it’s so slow!"
The screen broke within a month. No warranty.
This is the second one I bought for my parents. It has a big screen and is very good! !
It feels good and supports domestic products.
This phone has my favorite stereo dual speakers. It was the first time I used the Nokia 5530XpressMusic with stereo dual speakers and I couldn’t get enough of it.
"I obviously bought a shell membrane set, but when I received it, there wasn’t even a hair on it! The 618 business is so good!"
The fighter jet in the garbage. The screen broke just after I bought it.
Just received it... I'm used to looking at fruit screens... This one looks quite grainy... The appearance and quality are good... The price/performance ratio is very good...
"If you don’t buy it, the price will be reduced. If you buy it, it will be reduced by 100 yuan. JD.com is too deceptive."
The resolution is too low to use!
"As long as we can provide healthy milk, we will still support New Mengniu"
"The standby time is too bad. Even if it is fully charged, 2% of the battery is gone. It needs to be recharged twice a day!"
"Very good, very good, very good. Oh oh oh"
Mengniu milk tastes so bad that I will never buy it again.
I always support Huawei and have already purchased the third Honor X2 for my family. Huawei has excellent quality
The screen is not very sensitive! Just average! But the express delivery is really awesome!
"Never buy a suit. The price dropped so fast. The result told me that the suit cannot apply for price protection. It is too unreasonable. The price is reduced just after I bought it. It is too deceiving. When buying things on Jingdong, you still need to read the terms clearly."
"If the price is not worth it, it is better to spend one or two hundred more to buy Meizu."
"Whoever buys it will regret it, the resolution is terrible."
"I bought a mobile phone during the National Day, just two months ago. Not only is the phone stuck, but it freezes and gets hot when I simply record a video. This is also a problem for Huawei. Ask customer service and let yourself find after-sales service. . . . ."
This phone is not bad.
"Too bad, the response is too slow, return the product"
"Really rubbish, consumes a lot of power. It really feels like it’s useless."
The item has been received. My mother likes it very much. The sound is better than my Air. I am very satisfied. I support domestic products.
"I just received it, the pad looks good, but unfortunately, the tempered film sent is broken."
"The usage effect is not bad, it is just like a larger version of Huawei phone, smooth."
"Not bad, I bought it for grandma, although she rarely uses it... Not bad, I bought it for grandma, although she rarely uses it..."
"Very beautiful, beautiful, exquisite and durable! A satisfying purchase! Very good! Come again next time!"
"The whole machine is also quite exquisite. It was upgraded as soon as it came out. I looked at it and turned it on completely new. The 7-inch machine is for my mother to use, so she doesn’t need to wear reading glasses."
"There’s not even a film on the machine, what do you want me to do! This is really unethical."
"There are too many built-in software, and it cannot be rooted. It takes up more than half of the memory as soon as it is turned on. It is garbage. Hurry up and root. The processor also only has 8 cores 1.5G, not 8 cores 2G."
Mengniu drank too much.
"The phone is easy to use, but it doesn’t come with a phone film."
"It's okay, but the film is not that good. ,, and there are no headphones"
"The hardware of the tablet is very good, but unfortunately the software is still inferior. With such a configuration, it shouldn’t be a problem to open multiple applications, but Huawei’s software is just inferior. What a pity"
"Door-to-door delivery, cheap price, good value, worth buying"
"Bought for my mother to watch TV, very good"
"Fans of Huawei Honor, the product is really good."
. I need to refill the last bottle of milk. But I always feel that drinking Mengniu is dangerous.
Mengniu has changed its packaging and it looks much better than the previous Silly Niu.
This is the first mobile phone I bought from Huawei. I feel the quality is very good when I get it. I will also buy Huawei mobile phones in the future!
"The sound is really good, but sometimes the screen will be black and the response will be a little delayed, so let’s try it first. It would be great if the film can be applied and shipped. The ones I applied were all small bubbles, and I spent another 20 yuan to apply them outside."
"I like the current packaging of Mengniu milk, it looks much better!"
"None of the promised gifts were given. The screen of the mobile phone is really blurry. At this price, it is not as good as buying Meizu or Xiaomi. Really, the pixels are much better and you can enjoy 6 blocks of it."
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it, which makes me unhappy. . ."
The function is okay and it works well. It's not as bad as the reviews said. The internet speed is also good. But the delivery is too slow. I was still drunk after three days of delivery from Taiyuan to the Taiyuan store.
Mainly sold to children to watch cartoons. The previous one broke down twice in 2 years. This time I bought a better one to watch.
"Very stuck, I regret buying it, I can only watch TV"
"The logistics is super fast, the photo was taken on the first night and it arrived at noon the next day! It runs very smoothly!"
"It's okay, the response is fast, the sound quality is okay, I'll evaluate it later."
The phone is very good and genuine. My wife likes it very much.
I bought a tablet twice this month. It’s very good. My friends also think it’s good. Jingdong is good.
Two words are bad. Three words are bad. Four words are very bad.
These words really mean something. Cherish your life and stay away from Mengniu and Nutrilite.
"Now I no longer choose Mengniu when buying milk. ""Mengniu's response to non-apology for expired milk was questioned"" (from http:t.cn/zWnxfcG"
I haven’t drank Mengniu for many years!
"I just opened it, and many of the pictures on the phone were from June 2015. Is it a refurbished phone? ? ? ?"
I bought it for an old man. It’s very easy to use. It’s enough for general mini-games.
"Jingdong’s customer service is terrible. They just mess around every day, are perfunctory, and don’t do anything. Even if you apply for a return, you can’t get it back."
"Very useful, right?"
"Bad review, no purchase invoice"
"It looked like this just after I took it apart, I’m speechless!"
The resolution is so low that it looks like a fake
Haha. Why does the new mobile phone I bought last night have a mobile phone number on it? No wonder others call JD.com second-hand D
It’s so cool to play Honor of Kings
This is the saddest time in my history. I was bought by an online scammer with an IOU. I didn’t even know what the product was and I still had to pay back the money. I was so sad that the scammer’s whole family died.
"Not satisfied, there is a place to install phone cards, but I can't make calls. Is it a lie? It’s so deceiving."
I bought two and used them for just over two months. One of them had a screen that became inoperable. They sent it back and told me that it had water damage and was moldy inside. This reason is so awesome!
"The last time I bought it, it was okay. I recommended a friend to buy one too. It was very good and smooth."
The new one responds very quickly. It gets a little laggy after using it for a while. It’s okay for this price range.
"The tablet is great, the screen is large and clear. Watching TV doesn’t make your eyes tired at all!"
A very satisfying purchase~it comes with a package. The performance of m3 is good. The film is very good. The style and color of the leather case are very helpful. It's also fast. The courier guy has a good attitude. Support JD.com
I am once again disappointed with JD.com’s logistics...
"The logistics is super fast, it arrived the next day after placing the order! Great for reading e-books and videos! The battery is also durable, I like it! !"
This price is worth considering buying
"The phone is very good and no problems have been found so far. You are not allowed to inspect the goods at the beginning of delivery, and you only open them if you insist. How do you know if they are broken or not if they are not inspected? This is a bit unsatisfactory."
"Just don’t buy it yourself and warn the people around you! You have to understand that there are always stupid people in this world. Sorry, I made a typo again. I have been boycotting Mengniu for two years. It’s useless, people make money by making it"
Already installed but not used yet. Express delivery is very fast. It arrived the next day after taking the photo
"Charging is too slow and power consumption is too fast. The GPU is not good, but everything else is fine. The price fluctuates frequently and the price is not insured. How disgusting!"
"Good, economical"
"Very good, easy to use, no inconvenience at all."
Function is too bad
"Prices vary greatly, mobile phones are average"
It’s really rubbish. I bought 2 mobile phones on JD.com several times. I’m tired and don’t like it anymore.
"It won't get hot at all, and the 425 CPU is absolutely reliable in terms of power consumption."
The quality is okay. The screen is big enough. JD express delivery is very fast. I’m quite satisfied.
"It’s okay, I’ll comment after a while"
"The clarity is not enough, the borders are dirty, and the workmanship is rough. I am too lazy to return it."
"Jingdong is just good, nothing to say"
The product is very good and I am very satisfied. The delivery is fast.
"Well, not bad. . . . . . . . ."
Mengniu is safe
"I like Mengniu red date breakfast milk tomorrow morning, it doesn’t taste too good! Ha ha! @mengniudairy"
"Exquisite box, comes with a sticker. The M3 tablet is much lighter than the M2 and is compact and convenient to hold in your hand. A gift for my family and received many positive comments."
"After using it for less than a month, it keeps crashing and the response is super slow."
Mengniu’s banana milk is so cute
"The system is smooth, the Internet is fast, the colors are bright, the functions are many, and the touch screen is sensitive."
It's a very good model. It's exquisite and smart. The hot water is fast. The installer is also good and provides very enthusiastic service.
"It feels too bad. Although the price is cheap, the resolution is too low. The pictures are blurry when I receive them. Only high-definition ones searched online can make them clearer. The sound from the speakers is also muffled..."
"Personal experience~~~ Mengniu’s complaint and after-sales service are quite good, and the problem has been solved satisfactorily. Not bad. Now I have a new understanding of Mengniu. I will continue to work hard in the future (not an advertisement)"
"Very good, the screen is big enough for watching videos. The configuration is also good, and the delivery is even better. It arrived on the same day."
"The standby time is too short, it has to be charged in less than a day, and it automatically shuts down from time to time, which is not good."
"Very satisfied, harvested quickly"
"The screen is average, the casing is like paper, no invoice? ? ?"
"Cost-effective and the system runs fast. It’s just a bare metal device, so it’s troublesome to buy a protective case outside!"
"The water heater was installed in the afternoon, and I got a better discount on the order I placed using my mobile phone and got a gift in return. In the future, my friends will recommend me to buy from this store if necessary."
"Supports domestic production. If you want to buy something, please place an order quickly."
"The phone is good. After buying it for a few days, not only was the price reduced, but a leather case was also given as a gift. Bad review."
"Things arrived very quickly. I'm already using them. Overall, I feel good."
"Rejected Mengniu, speechless and fainted!"
"It's very good and easy to use. I just received the goods and the price was reduced by 200 yuan. The customer service applied for price protection, which is very good for Jingdong."
"Why! It couldn't have been Mengniu, right? Punish the real culprits severely!"
"Bought for a colleague, very good. Thank you JD.com"
"Huawei tablets are great, I bought two in a row"
"Not bad, buy it and watch movies, the screen is big enough!"
"Mengniu’s new packaging is pretty good-looking, but the high quality after the change is of course the most convincing! I hope Mengniu can truly change from the inside out! come on!"
"Not bad, very good, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, sensitive words ten, come on"
It took me a while to review it. It’s so rubbish. It’s so stuck. Is it a refurbished machine?
"The service attitude is like a dog, bad reviews, but the stuff is just okay. Mahler Gobi customer service."
"This is the first time I bought a tablet from JD.com. I bought it for my children to watch anime. It is very smooth and has no lag. For the price, it is good to support Huawei."
"Not bad, the price is reasonable too."
"If you don’t want to send it, don’t write it down. I wrote it down but refused to accept it, which was extremely disappointing. It feels a bit fraudulent! ! !"
"Where is the negative review? I want to make a complaint. This is the first time I bought a mobile phone for my parents. I was given less earphones, a selfie stick, and a protective case. It’s deceiving consumers. It’s hateful."
"The logistics speed is slow, the packaging is damaged, and the cuts are neat and it seems that someone has opened it. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase. If I don’t have money to buy tape, I can add more money. The machine has not been used yet. Please use it before commenting."
Why did I get a virus just after I bought it?
It looks good and the sound is great.
"Yeah, it's good. It's okay to use and it doesn't get stuck."
"You didn’t even give me a pair of headphones. Good or bad, good or bad."
I bought it at almost 11 o'clock last night and received it at noon today. The items are also very satisfying!
"The price was reduced just 3 days after I bought it, and I can’t guarantee the price. It’s a rip-off!"
"I have been using it for more than a month. It is very fast, can be displayed in split screen, has great battery life, is a good size, and the screen color is great!"
"Damn counterfeiters, let Mengniu pay a heavy price! !"
"I haven’t used it yet. I bought it as a gift for the annual party. It should be good, hehe."
"The workmanship is pretty good, no worse than Apple"
"Very good, beautiful appearance, smooth to use,"
"Difference,,,,,,'',. ? ? return"
I'm daydreaming... I haven't drank Mengniu for a long time...
Garbage. The screen plays old movies with flash. It took me a few days to comment.
"The tablet has been received. Shopping on JD.com is very convenient. Huawei's products are of good quality, practical, convenient and reasonably priced. Good reviews!"
My friend is very satisfied and helped me buy it. It runs quickly.
Cheap but not good. I have been fooled. The holes in the protective cover and tempered film are not in the right place.
"Pretty good quality, very good service"
"I have stopped buying Mengniu for several months, and I will hold on until it goes bankrupt."
"It's average, I feel like it's a little stuck sometimes."
It's so bad that I won't even reply if I return it for repair! ! ! ! Attention everyone
Jingdong really can’t afford to be hurt
"?Jingdong, I just found out that you are a liar, and the service is just as bad. The customer service is bad at everything. If you don’t have any problems with your purchase, you’re lucky. If you have any problems, just your service attitude!"
"It looks good, I hope I can win it"
"I just started using it, and it works fine, but the battery is used up too quickly. It is said that the Changxiang 6 has a large battery capacity. When I fully charged it, I only occasionally checked WeChat, and it consumed 43% of the battery in 4 hours. I am very doubtful about this."
Mengniu! So scary...!
JD.com is rubbish. The goods delivered have been used by others for who knows how long.
The resolution is unbearable
"That's it, the packaging is very simple, it doesn't turn on very quickly and I don't have headphones."
The price dropped* less than a week after I bought it. JD.com’s marketing is really bad. And nothing is given as a gift. The official website also gives away a leather case.
"Bad review. The membership card given is expired. They said that more than 100 yuan of the value of the membership card will be deducted for returns. If the gift is not redeemed, money will be deducted. I really think that I am China Mobile. I advise everyone not to buy! Bad review"
"Customer service is not online at all, why is it there even when I’m not buying?"
"Rubbish Jingdong, I don’t want to give anything"
"The goods arrived very quickly. After booting up and updating the system, it went very smoothly and was good."
"Cost-effective, fast, no lag,"
I tried it for a few days and it was better than I expected. I have no problem watching videos and movies online normally!
"Very satisfied, the size is just right, smooth and not stuck, easy to operate, the key is that it is more practical than Apple and has more software than Apple"
"During the 618 period, the speed is fast, the video is clear, and the sound quality is good"
"Mengniu, a garbage company that has had serious accidents over and over again, must be resolutely resisted."
The pixels are too bad and not worth the price.
Mengniu is really bad!
"This is the worst purchase ever. There is serious deception. The quality of the computer cannot be said. Let’s not mention Huawei’s customer service. Fortunately, I called JD customer service and finally solved the problem. The quality needs to be improved."
The courier was too bad! He said he wouldn’t let the goods be opened for inspection.
Buyers of JD.com’s self-operated products can trust JD.com
It took me a few days to review! Very useful stuff! Good quality and low price! Big brands are good! I also received the gift I sent! fine thanks! Customer service attitude is also very good
I am indeed stubbornly giving away Mengniu and treating customers as human beings.
"The machine heats up, the leather case says if it is there, and there are no activities written every time, which is a waste of other people's time."
The stuff is good. I bought it for my colleagues. I am very satisfied.
Huawei has good quality and after-sales service is close to home! ! !
"I don’t recommend you buy it for your elders. My mother has used it, but I can’t ask her to return it."
good! very good! Stay tuned!
"Very satisfied! Like, like, like"
I use it for my parents and it has been very good after using it for a long time. I support domestic brands and trust Huawei.
"On Christmas Day in 2005, I was sitting in the office writing about the dairy industry. At that time, Mengniu had not yet built a factory in Harbin. I clearly remember seeing the fireworks going off from the Dragon Tower through the window. Seven years flew by so fast."
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"The sound quality is very good, the feel is also good, and the logistics is super fast! Good review!"
"I used it after I received it. When I turned it on, the phone had 40% battery. After using it, the phone was very hot. I wonder if some people who said that their phones didn’t heat were doing so out of conscience. Otherwise, it’s okay. I’m used to good reviews."
"It sucks, I can't turn it on just two days after I bought it."
"It’s a bit ugly, I won’t buy it again next time! ! ! !"
"Attention everyone! Mengniu, which we trust, has been having problems frequently. Last night, plastic pieces were found in Mengniu’s double-layer cheese. It’s so disgusting!"
"Express delivery is nothing to say! quick! Baby it's okay! The customer service is just rubbish. If I want to ask a question, it seems like I owe them millions. They are indifferent! Why does Huawei hire such employees? Depend on"
Has always supported Huawei and is very useful
Bad review! The Internet is really bad! Often unable to connect to the Internet or disconnected! Even the mobile card and WiFi are disconnected and cannot be connected.
"Just arrived, brand new and unopened. The machine started up brand new and has no defects. I have to say that JD.com's express delivery is really fast. I placed the order on the 18th and received it on the morning of the 19th. I will add a review after using it."
"Just arrived, haven't used it yet, thank you"
"After using it for an afternoon, I feel very good. I can’t say enough about how easy this phablet is. I will support JD.com next time..."
It's very good. I haven't encountered any problems so far. I think I will use it for a while. Friends who want to buy it can buy it.
It feels good when I get it. It would be better if the price could be more suitable.
"Damn it. . . If you're a dull cow, you'll get kicked if you're a camel! Mengniu is so unethical in doing things that only harm mainlanders. Repost on Weibo"
Pretty good. This is the second one. Pretty good. This is the second one.
The brand’s service is really impeccable! ! !
"Haha, well, Mengniu’s customer service is now on Weibo, which can be considered an improvement."
Jingdong is as good as ever and trustworthy!
It’s too long and doesn’t look good. I regret buying it! Friends who don’t like rectangular shapes should be careful when buying!
The packaging is very good. I placed the order yesterday afternoon and received it this morning. JD.com is so awesome and the items delivered are also good. I support JD.com.
"It broke within two days, and it broke again within a few days after replacing it. Too bad to buy it! ! !"
"I bought 86 units of Honor Tablet 2. I forgot to select the invoice when placing the order. Now I have to make up for the invoice. JD.com has been delaying in giving the invoice. I spent more than 20W on JD.com in a year, and it turned out to be *!"
"The charger is not charging, which is not good at all."
"The day before yesterday, I wanted to drink cold milk, so I bought all Mengniu Guangming Yili. I haven’t started yet...pure pure milk. Want to drink Guangming Roof milk~"
"This is the second time I bought it. This small tablet has good sound and great appearance. Runs smoothly,"
"Good, the video is very clear, there is no lag when playing games, and the performance is very good."
Charged to 1% in an hour. . . Bad review! ! !
It is sold to children to play with. It is good and very easy to use. It has good functions when playing games.
"Can’t charge, so be careful when buying"
"There's a lot of nonsense, so don't be surprised! Forgive me! Anyway, if you like it, buy it, you won’t regret it!"
"It’s not very easy to use. Sometimes it seems like I’m being interrupted when watching videos, because they’re all in color! Not good, you get what you pay for"
"I bought my second one, it works great and runs smoothly. Support Huawei."
"It took a few days to evaluate, and I support domestic production. I wanted a black leather case, but the customer service ignored me."
"Genuine Huawei product, M3 is very easy to use. It directly upgrades to Android 7.0 after connecting to wifi for the first time. Huawei system is better optimized. Jingdong’s service is assured."
"It’s fast, has a sensitive touch, and has a classy appearance. It’s my favorite tablet!"
"Okay, there is a popular lottery recently, so I will join you. Anyone who reposts this Weibo with three friends will have the opportunity to give me a bottle of Mengniu Youyi C. The results of the lottery will be announced before tomorrow morning. I am at: http:t.cn/zjzBbAW"
I just bought this piece of junk and it started to freeze after a day of use.
"Moderate size, easy to carry on business trips, fast without lag, and can be expanded"
"I just received the one my husband bought yesterday. I don’t like it so I want to sell it exclusively. If necessary, I can resell it for 900. If you need it, please contact me at 13754900130"
"The products that were said to be given away were all lies, but the customer service explained that they had run out and everyone should buy with caution. The reputation is not good and the quality will be determined after using it for a while. I hope you don’t buy fakes."
"I bought it yesterday and the price is reduced today! Seriously deceiving consumers! More importantly, there is a problem with the phone! There is noise from the speaker,"
"It took me a few days to evaluate. The performance of the tablet is intact and stable. Brand new, kids love it. The appearance is simple and grand. 128G is enough for children."
The colors and everything are great! The sound is also very good! Overall so far very good
"The item is good, the screen is clear, the speed is fast, and the size is suitable. It is good for watching TV and playing games. The courier is very enthusiastic and the order delivery is very fast."
"The big screen is very good for the elderly, especially for videos."
Cheating Mengniu! !
"I forgive them too. Haha~ Drink Mengniu Sour Yogurt, the taste of youth."
"This one is cost-effective and responds well. It is worth buying this, Huawei is still good. I also use Huawei mobile phones."
Yili's milk bricks are not as delicious as Mengniu's. . .
"Not great, garbage among garbage, the resolution is so low, the camera is said to be 2 million pixels, which is not as high as the 300,000 pixels on my previous mobile phone."
"The pixels are good and exquisite, I like it very much."
"Yes, the logistics is very fast and the items are perfect. It is a very pleasant shopping."
"Great value, long standby time, stable and smooth system"
"Mengniu has done a good job in crisis public relations and made it public. This is a great opportunity. We hope that domestic milk can get out of the predicament and have less negative news. Teacher Luo refused the red envelope, good job."
"Not bad?, my son likes it very much."
The packaging is too simple and the box is deformed. I hope the tablet is okay.
"I seriously despise the products Huawei released this time. The wifi version has been upgraded to 007, but the LET version is still 003."
Did this barker really drink too much Mengniu?
"The negative review is because the protective case and film were given as a gift just two days after purchase, which is a rip-off. Spend dozens of dollars on film and covers in vain"
Not worth the price
"It was promised to be delivered to this city on the same day, but it was also stated above that the result was still one day later. The delivery boy was very nice."
"Sincerely, it’s 999 yuan on Double Eleven"
I bought it for my family. I ended up buying a bare metal machine and didn’t even come with a memory card. It took almost two days after I called the courier to get it delivered. The courier guy even turned off the phone. My satisfaction with JD.com is getting worse and worse now. Sell it. Very unhappy
"If you are sick, keep buying Yili! ...Does it mean that Mengniu is blacker than those selling cut cakes? The brain is full of cutting cakes. Mengniu’s public relations brain is flawed!"
"I just used it, so I don’t know yet. I’ll comment later."
"The express delivery is great, and watching the video is great"
"The price was reduced after three days of purchase, and no one answered me when I contacted customer service. This is JD.com’s service attitude. I don’t care about the sale. Generally speaking, there is a problem with the machine. The negative review is for JD. The minimum is one star. According to me, I should get one. No stars either."
"No invoice, no invoice, no invoice, important things are said three times"
"High configuration, large battery, long standby time, good value for money, smooth Internet access, one word good"
The earphones in the introduction are not included in the machine. I don’t know if they are second-hand machines. I talked to customer service and there was no response.
The after-sales service is not good. Returns and exchanges are always under review. It is obviously a bad phone. Why should consumers pay for it?
Fans of Guangming expressed vulgarly that they have always liked this Mengniu drink.
I gave it to a friend. I haven’t seen the real thing. My friend said it’s very good. The photos I got back are quite clear.
"You can calculate the space you get and buy a memory card yourself. You don’t necessarily have to buy a big tablet. It's very easy to use and the resolution is fine. The system is also very smooth. Worth buying. The more I use it, the more I like it."
There is no response when inserting the SIM card. It is recommended not to be deceived.
"No, super rubbish"
"As soon as I got it, I immediately upgraded it to Android 6.0, and then the system ran smoothly. It feels very good, I recommend buying it, especially the sound effect is very good"
"The price was reduced by more than 200 within a few days of purchase, bad review! I originally thought Huawei phones were good, but now it makes me sad. Although Huawei is upstairs in our company, I have decided not to use Huawei in the future."
I bought it for my sister-in-law and she said it performs well! Quick response! I love it!
"Mengniu organic banana milk, Zhenxiang! Oh I like it"
Do you retail giants dare to boycott the harmful Mengniu? ? ? @caoshiru
The machine is always stuck and the system cannot maintain stable operation. I hope Huawei will immediately pay attention to its efforts to improve stability and quality first.
"I’m very dissatisfied. I bought a lot of stuff before, but now I have nothing."
"As for the system, I don’t understand it and have only used it for a short time, so it’s difficult to evaluate it. However, using something requires this authorization and that authorization, so I have a little objection to this."
"Huawei's products are very cost-effective, with clear pictures, fast speeds, exquisite packaging, and support for domestic products. JD.com’s service is very good. You can rest assured to buy electronic products on JD.com. The gifts are very useful."
"The price is affordable, the express delivery is fast, and the installation is also fast. Although the installer is young and a novice, he is very patient and responsible. I am very satisfied! The insulation effect is very satisfactory."
Mengniu can’t be trusted either
Huawei's low-end products are okay to use. They are used by my parents to watch TV. They can insert memory cards. They are very good and cost-effective.
"It's okay. It's my first time using a tablet, and I haven't noticed any glitches or anything."
"I hope that Huawei, a domestic product, will continue to improve and reach a higher level!"
"It works fine, the logistics is fast, I trust JD.com!"
"It's not bad to use, but it's still a bit difficult to hold. . . ."
"Only 2 days and 48 hours later, the price of the phone was reduced by RMB 100 less than 5 hours after I got it. Jingdong, are you cheating on me?"
I really can’t stand it. The price dropped just three days after I bought it. I feel better after at least three months. I asked Jingdong customer service. Where is Jingdong customer service?
"Haha, I just wanted to inform your COFCO friends! Great prize! Facts have proved that not only Mengniu needs our 900ML Tiangu, but Tianyou Dairy also actively follows up, Fa Geweiwu @????"
Very good to use
"The current logistics is very good and the delivery is also very good. It's much better than before. Now I like shopping on JD.com. The quality is no problem, it's still very considerate, and the service attitude is first-rate."
"The goods are good, but the logistics is not good, which seriously affects my pursuit of Huawei products."
Very dissatisfied with my first purchase
"Even Mengniu and Yili cannot be eaten, and leaders cannot be left hungry and thirsty. This is very illustrative."
The delivery is really fast. I placed the order at night and it arrived at noon the next day. I haven’t used it yet. I will review it after I use it.
"Since I can't rate it without giving it one star, I'll give it one star! First of all, the packaging is so big. There is a flat plate in such a big box, but there is no filling and anti-shock film! ! !"
I bought it when my company held an event and I am very satisfied with it.
"A very good tablet, the effect is quite good"
It’s not bad to play with the baby bus for my daughter.
I gave it to a friend. I think it’s very useful.
"No, the resolution is always too poor"
"It's rubbish, it's a waste of RMB"
"So food from heaven is qualified, such as Mengniu and Sanlu"
"Big screen, plenty of power, good sound, and fast speed. The photos are slightly lacking compared to other high-end phones."
"Shopping on JD.com, quality guaranteed"
"Although it is a thousand-yuan machine, it uses its own Wi-Fi signal. It’s not a fake phone, right?"
"The screen is big enough, easy to use, and logistics is fast."
Just use it. The price is so don’t be too picky
"Second purchase. It didn't even drop a point. Bad review, it depends on your delivery speed, otherwise it is cheaper, and it also has headphones. So bad review"
"The ones given are old goods from January 9, 2012."
"Mengniu's is quite similar to this banana milk, just lighter than it @apple?"
"Very good, very satisfied"
"It’s a rubbish phone with no 5 hours of standby time on a full charge! The after-sales service is rubbish, and when you ask him questions, he’s completely wrong, and he’s just bullshitting you."
It's not as good as it was said. The memory is only 10G and it's very laggy.
What rubbish? It can’t charge enough.
"The items delivered were damaged. I trust JD.com too much. Hey, failed."
"The goods were received, but none of what was promised was delivered. The metal ring on the screen turned out to be plastic, and the paint peeled off at the slightest touch."
"It's okay. I mainly read e-books. Huawei's products are acceptable in China and charge quickly. BYD's charger is great, but it doesn't support telecom cards."
"The actual product is the same as the description on the website, very useful"
The stuff is very good and the price/performance ratio is good
"Mengniu is disgusting. It can't do well in creativity, but it shoots itself in the foot."
"Please take a look at those stupid celebrities who always make commercials that harm children, and call for a boycott of Mengniu!"
"Neither the pins nor the film will be given, nor will there be any real pitfalls."
"EXO-M, I hope to win the Newcomer Award at the Newcomer Ceremony. This is a dream shared by you and your fans. Come on, I wish the Mengniu Sour Yogurt Music Chart Newcomer Ceremony a success!"
Delivery is extremely slow and service experience is extremely poor
"I won’t tell you how the item is, but the price was reduced the day after I bought it* I really can’t accept it."
"High cost performance, serious light leakage in two places."
"Not bad, just started using it"
"I have embarrassed the Chinese people. When I got out of the subway and went up the stairs, I was pushed away by a strong foreign man carrying a big bag... I want to drink more Sanlu, Mengniu, Guangming, and Yili to become stronger!"
"I regret buying it, very bad"
"It’s a junk phone, it took me a few days to review it. The battery lasts for 3 hours at most, the wireless network reception is poor (the 10Mbps I installed only uses 2 mobile phones), and the mobile phone response is extremely slow! I don’t want to give a single star"
"Very cost-effective, beautiful appearance and fast speed"
"I finally bought a mobile phone online, but when I came back, the charger was broken. No one was left."
The strawberry-flavored Mengniu Future Star and the big SpongeBob SquarePants are delicious.
"I don’t know, I haven’t used it yet, I’ll talk about it after I use it."
The package I ordered yesterday came with a tempered film cover. I added 100 yuan. Today these two items become gifts. I am not satisfied.
The battery will run out of power if you don’t use it for a day! I have always trusted JD.com! I won't buy it again in the future.
"Thank you for your hard work. Mengniu has worked hard on 2.30. I am so grateful! It’s really hard work. I was also on vacation during those days, thank you to Mengniu for the hard work. The Mengniu milk was produced on February 30. Mengniu has worked hard, and COFCO has worked hard! It's hard work"
"Not bad, it’s great to watch movies or play games on the big screen"
"Bought for the company, very good, this model of machine is very cost-effective"
"The button was knocked out! Forget it, just make do with the cheap phone. Huawei disappoints me a bit."
I no longer buy Mengniu
I like Mengniu red date kefir.
Mengniu is awesome!
"The phone is pretty good, but when I chose it, I didn’t know why I was given a customized mobile phone. I called customer service and they said I had chosen the wrong phone and they wouldn’t take care of it. I now have a China Unicom 4G card and it can’t be used. I’m so sorry."
"Not bad, the video is quite clear"
"Reply Haha. Hello, thank you for your love for Mengniu products. I am Mengniu WeChat customer service. Welcome to follow me."
"Jingdong 618, affordable price, comparison of new and old products. Decisively give the iPad to the elderly."
I don’t like any Mengniu products! ! ! Afraid of eating dead people! ! ! http:t.cn/zWgWTHX
Those with virtue and talent will be given special emphasis; those with virtue but without talent will be cultivated and used; those with talent but without virtue will be restricted in employment; those without virtue and talent will not be employed. Mengniu employs standardized and refined personnel
"There is nothing inside, the pixels are too poor, it feels like a refurbished phone"
Weird talk! absurd!
Absolute bad review 7527
"Pretty good! At first, the WIFI connection was not fast, so I consulted customer service, who patiently helped solve the problem. I’ve been using it for a few days and it feels pretty good. I feel comfortable watching movies and listening to music!"
"I've had it for a month, but today I can't turn it on for a long time. well"
"It can be used to store mobile phone memory cards, which is not bad. The speed is also very good. No problems have been found yet."
"Not bad ~ I bought it for studying and reading ~ I feel it is more convenient than an iPad, but each has its own strengths ~ This one is more suitable for me at this stage ~ The performance is also good in all aspects ~ If you like it, you can buy it ~ Support domestic products and support Huawei!"
"I ordered it last night and received it this morning. The logistics was very fast and the service attitude was very good. Thank you, courier brother."
I use one for myself and bought 3 for my friends. They are easy to use. I trust Huawei.
"The black edges are really big. The first time I participated in the rush sale, I bought the Honor x2 * but refused to place an order until the price changed back to *. Oh, is it interesting? Why bother playing tricks on us if it’s not true? I’m an old diamond after all."
I was taken advantage of and the price was reduced within a few days.
"Nice seller, good stuff, cheaper than buying in a physical store"
Buy something! Really can only watch TV! Playing Honor of Kings Haha I didn’t believe it at first but now I believe it. Not as good as Apple 2688 but not as good as Apple 2688! All accounts have been blocked
"Just like I stopped drinking Mengniu, I stopped eating shark's fin. But the two are different. Not drinking Mengniu is hate, not eating shark fin is love! Mengniu NULL-1 What kind of bullshit logic, you don’t even want your face and butt!"
"Not bad, just like what you see in the picture, *the price is not bad either"
Bad review. I just bought it and haven’t received it yet. It was reduced by 50. I want to refund it.
"The mobile phone is very good, the screen is big, stylish enough, very convenient to use, and the effect is good for taking pictures and souvenirs. Thank you!"
"The screen and sound quality are pretty good, and the CPU is passable. I can’t buy my favorite iPad at this price, so I have to choose between Xiaomi and this one. The stereo speakers are also good."
huab I won’t recognize you if I change my vest. I feel like vomiting when I hear Mengniu
"The price-performance ratio for the big sale is too high, and the system is very smooth after the update. Forget about big games. It's perfect for reading books or watching TV series. The sound effect is really great, better than ordinary Bluetooth speakers on the market."
"It feels ok. I promised to have an invoice, but I don’t even have a ticket. I’m afraid there will be problems in half a year without warranty."
This price is worth having
"It is an Android 5.1 system, and Android 6.0B215 has been pushed. I don’t know if I need to upgrade. The appearance is very beautiful"
Choosing Mengniu means choosing health
"Without headphones, applying for after-sales service is very troublesome, and it gets very hot after being used for a while, and fingerprints and the like are also troublesome."
The sound quality is superb. . . . . . . . . The price of ninety-nine is still using thirty coupons. Is the price good?
"No invoice, bad review."
The volume button cannot be turned down and cannot be used at all. I am very optimistic about Huawei's quality. . . . .
"The battery is so rubbish, I just left it there for a day and didn’t use it. It ran out of power."
Already returned. not good
"Bad review, bad review. The game is so stuck that I can’t move."
I've been using it for a week and it's pretty good. I haven't found any problems so far. It's great.
"The charging temperature is too high, there are no free gifts, the packaging is very poor, and only 10g of memory is left after purchase. I don’t recommend everyone to buy it. You will regret it if you buy it."
"Because Mengniu changed the packaging to something more attractive, I bought a whole box after taking elective courses~~~ It turns out that I am not STRONG, but just puffy. That carton of milk cost me 70% of my power..."
"Gave it to my mom as a birthday gift, she likes it very much, it’s enough for watching TV and playing games!"
"A very good tablet, the colors and video are quite good and clear"
"Mengniu, let’s see if you still dare to drink! I won’t drink Mengniu anymore after I’m beaten to death."
"I haven’t installed it yet, I’ll comment after using it."
It's very easy to use. The boss is satisfied. I don't know if it's brand new.
It’s a rubbish mobile phone that won’t be used for half a day after being fully charged. It will use half of the battery the whole night when it’s on standby. Whoever buys it will regret it.
"The resolution is too low, the screen is gray, and the response speed is slow. It's not worth the price."
"There is no problem with the goods, but JD.com’s major appliances are too rubbish."
16g is storage. This tablet is equipped with Kirin 930 CPU. It is cheap and very cost-effective.
not bad. . . . . . . .
It would be shameless not to replace the monitor if it has a problem
"This is the second time I went to Jindong to buy something. I couldn’t tell whether the item was good or bad in a short time. Before buying, Huawei customer service said that it would come with a protective cover... but I couldn’t see if it arrived. I left the matter to Jindong. That’s enough."
Poor resolution and unclear image quality
I bought it for an old man. I liked it very much after receiving it.
"I have always liked Huawei. My mobile phones at home are all Huawei, so I decisively chose Huawei when buying a tablet. I was not disappointed. The sound quality is very clear and the sound quality is beautiful. Support Huawei!"
good. . . . . . . . good. . . . . . . .
The sound is noisy when making phone calls. There is no flashlight and no earphones. Charging is very slow.
"Everything is very good. Compared with other mobile phones, the signal connecting to WF is not dominant."
It's a bit laggy. It takes a few taps on some parts of the screen to react.
"The film I received was broken. When I spoke to customer service, no one responded. The service couldn’t keep up."
"I bought it for my mother and she likes it very much. Because the mobile phone is also made by Huawei, the tablet is also made by Huawei. It is easier for her to operate."
"The price dropped just 2 days after I bought it, which makes me extremely upset."
"?Very satisfied, it is genuine. The installation is also very beautiful!"
"Bought this for my son, he said it is very useful."
The tablet is really bad. The new tablet is so slow when it is turned off and charged. It takes half an hour to charge. It is probably a defective device. I suggest you not buy it. Whoever buys it will be in trouble. Returns are not refundable. I will give the review in my real name.
Tell me how to let others drink this. I just watched this after eating breakfast. I felt sick and wanted to vomit! I will no longer support Mengniu @consumer complaints
Is it bad to drink Mengniu nutritional breakfast milk at night?
looks rough
Easy to bend. No warranty. Please be aware.
"Not bad, nothing to give"
"Very bad, more and more disappointed with JD.com! I paid a deposit, but the goods were out of stock, and the deposit will not be refunded! Super disappointed"
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good!"
"Bad review, bad review! Bad review! No invoice! There is no LeTV card either! Bad review! Sent a message but no reply!"
"The package they were sent was tattered, and there was some smearing. Sure enough, it was the same as other people’s comments, the seal seemed to have been tampered with. md I’m not a receiver, right?"
The quality was so bad that it broke within a month!
"Not only Mengniu, but also Mengren. It’s so cheating."
"Bought in a flash sale, there is a flash sale limit! ! ! The price is really cheap"
"The things are very ordinary, the price is expensive, and not worth the money!"
"I didn’t take care of anything after buying it, bad review! The screen is broken, the colors are unreal when watching movies, and the memory doesn’t seem to be that big."
"Negative review. When I bought it, I asked about the built-in earpiece. But I bought it without it. When I called, the echo was louder than talking. Do I need to leave a negative review?"
"It’s not good, it’s slow, it freezes, I don’t want to say anything else. There is noise when recording."
"Jingdong shopping is very safe, the screen is large and clear, the Internet is fast, it can be used as a tablet and can make calls, so it can be used for two purposes."
"Heroes, the future is uncertain here, drink a bowl of Mengniu to strengthen your courage! !"
"There have been twists and turns, but I really didn’t expect it. I think the quality of Huawei is very good, and the ones sent by Huawei have bright spots."
Bought for a friend and very satisfied! Support Huawei!
"I like the product very much. The only thing is that I bought it wrong. Just try it out and the response is okay. Sometimes it’s faster and sometimes it’s slower, but it’s still very good! Support JD.com and always support it"
"The tablet is very good, not expensive, and worth buying."
"Mengniu’s new packaging, produced by Dantong, must be a high-quality product"
"Not bad, the battery is relatively durable."
"I haven't received the item yet, but it has already been received. What a scam."
I'm a little disappointed and don't want to say more! First negative review on JD.com!
Why does the screen flicker on and off?
"Fast logistics, delivered the next day"
"It's great, I can watch movies and play games. I'm satisfied with it in every aspect. It's fast. I always support Huawei. It's much better than So-and-so Guo!"
It turns out that the root cause of fraud comes from education. Did we wrongly blame Mengniu?
"When the card is out of service, is it running on 3G?"
"One star for JD Logistics. The machine is not good, the display is not clear, the speaker is noisy, and I can’t hear clearly even at the highest volume, and the video lasts for two hours after 8 hours of charging. In order to read the courseware, I looked at the 128G expandable card, but it turned out to be useless."
"I risked my life by drinking a bottle of Mengniu, and ended up feeling sick since 4 a.m."
Bought this for my mom and she said it works well. But my dad dislikes the small 8-inch screen?
"Continue to resist. Changing the soup without changing the medicine is useless... A bitch wants to be a saint by changing clothes. It's useless. As long as I see the word ""Mengniu"", I won't buy it..."
Mengniu! I am a smart and good boy!
"Not bad, give it a try"
"Alas, I thought it could be used as a computer, but who knew it was a large-screen mobile phone that couldn't accept a card?"
"The tablet is a good size and feels relatively lightweight. There are not many software installed at present, and there is no lag when running the game."
"Cheaper than Huawei Mall?, support JD.com! The courier guy is very fast and dedicated, click?"
"The most unpleasant shopping experience since I entered JD.com. When I took the photo, I asked customer service about three gifts, but not a cent. There are no paper invoices either. Bad bad bad bad review,"
Honor tablet is a good domestic brand
It’s too stingy to not even give you a protective film.
"The product is good, but the logistics is too slow. I placed an order for JD.com’s self-operated products on December 13th and received the goods on December 16th. Bad review! Hope to improve logistics speed."
Screen resolution is quite low and not worth it
"Very good, good, really good, worthy of you"
"Good reviews, good to use, my mother likes it very much"
The machine is very good and the delivery is fast!
"I originally liked Yili milk, but after drinking Mengniu banana milk, I suddenly felt better. From now on, smile, everything in this world is trivial except life and death. Mengniu"
"Warranty card, manual and nothing else. Bad review! Even if it is flat"
"Bought for the company, the price/performance ratio is very high, and the packaging is actually one machine and one box."
"This thing is not good. I just buy something here once. The things I buy are not big. I also give you Q.Q barrage every day, making you doubt your life. This bad review is for J Dong."
"Mengniu, just for a little bit of happiness"
"I like the phone very much, but I have the urge to return it for the first time. I placed an order for * yuan on the 11th. After the goods arrived on the 12th, I checked online and found that the price was * yuan. One star is for the merchant's sales behavior. This price change makes the seller very upset. Chilling."
"The strange thing is that this problem sometimes exists and sometimes it doesn't, so even after-sales service can't explain it clearly."
The baby has been received and feels very good!
For mom. Hope the quality is excellent!
It’s been about ten days since I bought it and it feels good. Very convenient to use
The quality is pretty good and it’s easy to use.
"From the current evidence, I don’t see any problems with Mengniu. If I support local companies, I will buy Mengniu."
This is my first time using Huawei. The screen is great and the sound quality is average!
"The screen is quite big, I can make calls, and the design is user-friendly. I have been using it for a while and the quality is acceptable."
"JD.com has fast delivery, good service, guaranteed product quality, and a trustworthy brand. It is a product worth buying!"
I just drank it from yogurt. I will never drink Mengniu again! What the hell is this!
very good! Order in the morning and arrive in the afternoon
"Okay, okay, it’s great to watch a movie"
It’s just that the screen doesn’t work very well
"Bad review! After buying it, the price was reduced. The price protection was not supported. The machine crashed once after I bought it. I advise you not to buy it. It’s accurate (JD.com is so sad, I can’t even fight)."
"Gave it to my mother to watch the video, the size is just right"
"Very good machine, I have bought several. While the price is cheap, I quickly bought two more units for my colleagues."
"It's okay, but my dad is still not used to using it."
"Not bad, relatively smooth, but the black borders are too big and the virtual keys are very uncomfortable. Overall, I'm satisfied."
"Support domestic products, support Huawei, Huawei tablets, a good choice! Responsive to use and stylish in appearance! The system is stable!"
"Used by the company for testing, highly praised. You have to go to JD.com to buy things. It’s faster and more economical. Once you’re used to your speed, others really don’t want to use it anymore."
There was no LeTV card included in the package at all. I was deceived and I was very annoyed.
The phone is a little curved and I can fit two pieces of paper into it. The packaging is too poor and the logistics is too slow. It didn’t arrive for a few days. I had to pick it up myself. Bad review.
This tablet is really rubbish. I recommend you not to buy it.
"I'm really drunk, the service is very poor, the customer service said three times about the price reduction after purchasing. One time they said price protection was possible, and the other time they couldn't. You can only make consumer rights protection calls."
"Very fast. But the packaging feels very old, and the protective film was not included."
"Yes, trust JD.com, trust Huawei, continue next time"
I don’t know if it’s my fault that I bought this or it’s the same thing. It’s been almost a month since I bought it and the screen has gone black twice.
I just drank an unknown substance after drinking Mengniu Guanyi milk. It made me feel sick and miserable. I will never drink Mengniu again! also! No! drink! Got it!
"The sound quality is good, but the wifi interruption is too serious and it makes trouble every now and then. Bad review!"
This is the second one I bought. It’s really a good gift for the elderly and children.
Very good. I have nothing to say about the quality of JD Logistics.
"The purchase is expensive, and the price was reduced before I received the goods. Are you unhappy?"
"Just this package for 2,000 yuan, what a joke! It seems like someone opened it and then sealed it! There are no protective measures inside. Electronic products are thrown around and you do this! Buy a cup with foam! Waste logistics"
I just got it. It starts up and runs very smoothly. There is no lag at all. The fuselage feels very good.
The charger broke so quickly and it was only charged a few times. The quality is really poor.
The correct answer is ~ Mengniu Banana Milk Special ~ It’s time to announce the Christmas gifts ~ Congratulations
"I bought the tablet to play games, but it is far from the effect I expected. I still can’t use it to play large-scale online games."
"Not bad, well worth it!"
"Not great, the battery ran out after four hours of playing games, and the touch is not good. I just bought it, and I was drunk too."
I drank a bottle of Yili’s sweet strawberries today~~I suddenly want to buy Mengniu~~
"It's grand and beautiful. My dad likes it very much. The sound quality is also good, but the Internet signal strength is not very good."
"I bought it for my mother, just a large mobile phone. Easy to operate, clear screen, fast running speed, very good! Support Huawei, support JD.com!"
It saves power and the sound quality when listening to music is very clear.
The size is just right for your baby to use for learning. Playing games can also be great.
This Mengniu yogurt is delicious~
"The price-performance ratio is good, and the quality of Huawei is worth buying. I hope Huawei will do better and better!"
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la machine
The goods are cost-effective and the logistics is fast.
"Shipping is slow, not used, looks okay"
"It's still a bit heavy, but otherwise it's fine. . zzzzz"
A satisfying purchase. The products on JD.com are really cheap and of good quality. My son insisted on buying it. The original copy was stolen by a thief. It is worth buying.
It’s so hard to drink Mengniu Youyi c. Remember not to buy it.
The delivery is super fast and the interface is clear. I feel pretty good so far. The price is also cheaper than in physical stores.
"The thing is generally okay, but the anti-fall performance is a bit poor. It uses a metal-plated plastic frame, and at first I thought it was an all-metal body."
I like the slogan of this Mengniu advertisement.
"I took a look at the English translation of Mengniu's ""Just for a Little Happiness"" in the advertisement inserted in the middle of the NBA preseason game. It really says ""little happiness matters"" in a row of very small gray characters! God translates!"
The quality is not good. The cartab was damaged after two pulls. Now you can see a hole and there is photo evidence to prove it.
I just got it and haven’t used it yet. Do you know what the function is?
"The stuff is pretty good,,, I bought it for someone, I didn’t say anything bad about it."
"Thank you, Mengniu official website has spoken, we are so successful! That’s right, immunity can be enhanced every time you take a supplement. Only by taking a supplement every day can you enhance your immunity. Please remember this."
The packaging is very careful. Inside is a regular product packaging box. It’s a good tablet and runs fast.
"Not very good, even Meituan can’t get in, can’t book a seat"
"I received the tablet, and the logistics was fast. I couldn’t put it down because of the style and color. I was even more surprised when I opened it. A very practical tablet, highly recommended to buy."
"The 8-inch tablet is not big, but it is easy to carry when going out, and it is not bad after using it for a few days."
Super cool and easy to use
"The sound quality is good, perfect for watching movies and listening to music!"
I was fooled by this company's advertising.
Delivery is too slow
Not bad. I used it to send my girlfriend to watch movies. Visual effects and sound effects are both good
"The machine is very good, the genuine product is fast and beautifully packaged. I will always come to JD.com to purchase."
"No free film, bad review! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"A very good tablet, everything is good and it feels good in hand"
Just two words garbage garbage
"Boys will be boys, clumsy. Cut into such large pieces, there is even salad dressing on it, which is sour and greasy. Cut it into small pieces, pour it with yogurt, and add a piece of Mengniu yogurt ice cream, that's how delicious it is. Pay attention next time."
"It doesn’t matter if you have a gift or not, the key is that the price should be right. I really don’t know what to do with the knives I gave you."
Not very sensitive. But it runs relatively smoothly.
"The product is okay, but the brand has low pixels!"
"So Mengniu does not produce inferior milk, they are just porters of black-hearted cows"
"Unrealistic, one less card slot, dual SIM card dual standby cannot expand the storage"
"It's a great Huawei tablet. It's a good size and can make calls. It was just a gift for my mother to upgrade her old phone. JD Logistics takes 12 hours from ordering to your doorstep, praise, praise, praise."
Easy to use. quick! Very good!
"I placed an order yesterday and the price was reduced today, but there is still no price protection! Are you, JD.com, too poor and crazy? Just stole 80 yuan from me in one day"
"Although the P10 is dead, I still have the P9. It took me two months to reply again!!! Among all Huawei phones, the P9 may occasionally freeze and lose power, but the camera effect is really good! ! ! ! 1 point for P10."
"I just got it and haven't used it yet. JD.com's shipping packaging is very poor. It's just a cardboard box and it's not even empty. One of the corners of the flat package was seriously damaged after a fall, so I wanted to return it and wait to see if it affects its functionality."
Is it good for consumers to lower the price and promote promotions after two days of purchase?
Bought for someone else! Things are OK! A friend got it and said he was very satisfied!
"The quality is too bad! And I checked it is not a good phone, JD.com also sells such a phone!"
"The Internet speed is fast, watching movies is good, the screen is clear, the operation is smooth, and the sound quality is good."
The price dropped by 200 just a week after buying it. I’m depressed because the phone is too big and easily deformed.
"I bought a 10-inch m2 and an 8.4-inch m3, both of which are very good. I kept this one mainly because it is convenient to hold in my hand. The screen is delicate, responsive, and the colors are very good. I recommend buying them."
"After all, the money is small, so it’s not bad. The actual memory is only 11G."
"The tablet is okay, the system is smooth and the sound is loud. When it arrived, the packaging box was a cardboard box with leaks on both sides and transparent tape on it. The packaging was too shocking."
Mengniu is not pure
It worked fine. There was a thin line in the screen for the first time. I contacted the after-sales service and the product was replaced quickly. The after-sales response was fast.
"Watch this issue. An exclusive TV interview with Sun Yiping, the new president of Mengniu. For more exciting content, please pay attention to ""Chinese Operators"" broadcast by China Business News at 22:30 tomorrow and Ningxia Satellite TV at 18:00 on Sunday."
It feels good and starts up quickly
"The wireless wifi reception performance is weak. With the same signal strength, Huawei mobile phones can connect, but this is unstable."
"I am extremely shameless. Mengniu, you are so shameless! Positive energy? Damn it, you have the nerve to say positive things?"
"Because I am not RMB, not everyone likes me, because I am not Mengniu Pure Milk, so I cannot be that pure, and because I am not Mona Lisa, I cannot smile at everyone."
"No, the quality of the machine is pretty good"
"|| Come and boycott Mengniu, this ""traitor"" who has harmed his own compatriots and harmed the health of the Chinese people."
"Not bad, not bad. It can be divided into 12 interest-free installments, which is much more affordable, but there are almost no free gifts. Others have a lot of products but they can't be divided into 12 interest-free installments. Apart from feeling that the gifts are being deducted, I am quite satisfied with everything else."
"Very good, shipping and arrival speed are very fast"
"Rubbish tablet, the aspect ratio is seriously uncoordinated! Huawei can also make such LaJi products! Got it!"
"The screen will go black by itself. The tablet is too long, not wide enough, and does not feel strong in the hand, but the display is fine."
"I received the stuff, it’s good"
"Yes, this is my third X2. There is nothing wrong with it. It has always been easy to use. The screen is clear, calls are good, and the external speakers are good. It is worth playing. I just like the big screen. The whole family uses Huawei, which is no worse than Apple. Support Huawei."
"After placing the order, the price of other products purchased also dropped. There are too many traps in the price guarantee terms, and completion is just a gimmick. Just like the price of the tag remains unchanged, even if the price is always on sale, it does not count as a price reduction."
"The purchase required a paper personal invoice, but when it was delivered, it was an electronic invoice."
"I deliberately waited to use the phone for a week before evaluating it. The delivery is super fast, I placed the order in the morning and it arrived in the afternoon. The phone is generally good and suitable for watching videos. I bought the last phone from JD.com."
"Only the 128g version has headphones, the 64g version is the least cost-effective version, I bought the wrong one, and there is a problem with the charging socket."
"The quality is not very good. It is said to be dual-SIM dual standby. In fact, you can only carry one SIM card."
"I received it, and I regret it a bit. Apart from the hardware upgrade, the appearance is much uglier than the x1. It has extremely ugly black edges and is crashing."
"Very good! The child can watch TV very clearly, react quickly and there is no lag. A very satisfying purchase"
"In use, the phone is quite good."
"The resolution is low, it is better to buy Xiaomi, the price is about the same. Regret it."
Not bad. Use it first and talk about it later!
well! I can only say that I am speechless...
"The screen is very clear, the size is just right, and the Internet is very smooth."
I don’t know if the battery of the mobile phone is 5000 mAh. It has been out of charge for a day. The phone is still stuck and freezes. I wonder if it is genuine.
My stomach tells me that I have fallen in love with you @???yogurt
"What the hell. After just one day of use, it won’t charge or turn on. Returning to the factory is always a problem."
"I just bought a mobile phone. When I opened it, I found that the screen had a bad pixel. When I applied for after-sales service, I was told that there were three or four blocks. If you want to buy it, you need to be careful."
"This joke, along with the old lady’s escape and Mengniu’s self-defeat, are among the top three # cutcake # jokes in my mind."
You're too cruel... Anyone who tells you they won't make noise must be Mengniu drinking too much
"Generally, there is some lag when I just bought it."
"The tablet should still be good, and so is Huawei. I haven’t used it yet, waiting for testing. Bought two at once. The size is quite suitable. Express delivery is also pretty good. It takes one and a half days to adjust the goods."
"The size is right, very nice and safe, and the quality is good."
It’s a rubbish mobile phone that broke down after only 10 days of purchase and no warranty was given.
"I am very satisfied with the items, and the express delivery is also quite fast. It is a very good shopping experience. I wish the boss a prosperous business and better and better."
"The clarity is very poor, not as good as expected"
"The people of the motherland sent congratulatory messages, and Yilimeng Niu was also named as sponsor. It’s not easy to like a girl for six years. I finally achieved success! You must be so happy now, hehe, you have to give birth to a baby as soon as possible, and you can get extra credits."
I have been using the tablet for a few days before I can evaluate it. The performance is pretty good and it is very easy to use.
"This is the second time I bought it, the quality is the same and I will buy it again in the future!"
"Seriously, my hands and neck hurt after watching a 10-minute movie."
"It's really good, quite good, the sound effect is great, it's really clear"
Good Good OK
"The machine has not been used yet, and there is nothing delivered. I was told that it was available before I bought it, but after I received it, there was nothing. I said that it would not be delivered, and I had to buy everything from scratch."
"The price of this machine is less than 1,000 yuan. It is far beyond my personal imagination. It is perfect."
"It feels very smooth to use, there is no lag, the heat is not very obvious, the sound is also good, praise!"
"What's the point of changing the appearance? I won't change the inside either. Anyway, I won't buy Mengniu in the future."
"I feel that the appearance is not very good, and the system interface also needs to be redesigned."
"The texture and appearance are pretty good. It is mainly used for reading documents and videos, and the configuration is completely sufficient. Hope it's comfortable to use"
**Jingdong sells me refurbished phone
"I suspect it is not genuine or has been swapped. The complimentary tempered film is different from the one in the picture, and the phone I received has a tempered film on it. The tempered film is much smaller than the screen, and the hole position of the phone case is greatly deviated."
"No headphones, front camera pixels are terrible"
Downloading things is super slow
Good ah ah ha
"I tried it for a few days before evaluating it. Because I installed it myself, there was no hot water coming out. I thought it was broken but later I found out it was due to insufficient water pressure. The water temperature is also hot enough. Good reviews"
"Very good, cheap, good performance, big screen display, give dried beans for personal use, I will come again next time, you can also make calls and send text messages,"
The outer packaging has been cut and the packaging has been opened. It needs to be confirmed whether the product has been exchanged!
"What kind of tablet is it? There is no invoice, the pixels are terrible, no one will respond to the request for return, it is terrible, it is just for use."
A nice purchase! relatively good
"Trust JD.com, a good tablet"
The display is rather blurry~
"The one I bought for my mother* worked fine. I was promised a protective case, but it didn't come with it. I also asked customer service to get the same results. . . I have to spend *money to buy another one myself. Oh, I’m so disappointed."
"Original and authentic, second time purchase, delivery is super fast."
Bought for my friend as a birthday gift for his child.
"I've always wanted to eat Mengniu's ""Green Mood"" in Singapore, with its rustling texture and fresh mung bean aroma. It's a pity that it doesn't sell well here. Just search it on Baidu and learn to make it yourself."
"I also accepted it. The packaging of the mobile phone is extremely dirty. It is a second-hand product. I saw that the warranty expires on March 9, 2018. I also accepted it."
"The resolution is terrible, and the charging is so slow. Hey, it’s cheap but not good. It’s better to add a few hundred yuan to buy the Apple mini version and just use it. The customers behind you, don’t be fooled. The picture quality is really bad."
"I regret and am disappointed. I suggest you go to someone else’s store to look at it before buying it. I regret that I only looked at it after I finished buying it. I found out that it was the most expensive one, and it didn’t have anything. Other people’s houses still had membranes, leather cases, etc. well"
This is my third purchase. The price is good and the quality is good.
"I bought it for my father-in-law, so it can play games and watch videos. The price is excellent!"
"The product is too heavy and the user-friendly design is not in place. I can replace it with other products, so I will give you 1 point and express delivery 5 points."
"I have tap water, but Huawei’s stuff just doesn’t work."
"I feel good about it, but I don’t really understand it. I bought it for my child."
"The price was reduced the day after purchase* and the difference was not refunded, which is very cheating."
"Huawei, the whole family trusts it, the big screen is easier to use, like it"
"The stuff is good, and the packaging is authentic at first glance. It has not been turned on yet. I believe in JD. They are all old customers. JD.com is trustworthy. I will give it a five-star rating."
"I don’t know how to evaluate it. The one I bought on the 11th didn’t come with any gifts. The event continued on the 12th, and I also got a wallet and a tablet film. I am a stepmother inside and out, but I didn’t get anything. I received the goods so clean. ,"
I didn’t receive the gift or invoice. I told Huawei customer service that they couldn’t find my order... I’m sad. I won’t have the desire to buy anything on JD.com next time. It’s so bullying.
"It's relatively easy to use, the clarity is very high, and it's very smooth to use."
"I bought it for the event, 100 yuan cheaper than now? 8.0 inches, clear picture, high resolution, small and exquisite, easy to carry. The protective film provided is not well applied, please ignore it."
"Very good, fast delivery and guaranteed. Trust JD.com. . . ."
"The battery is not durable and the packaging box is completely sealed without film, only 2 pieces of tape are attached."
"Mainly for navigation, it's pretty good."
"It's a good phone, a trustworthy phone. Support domestic production."
The stuff is good and the delivery is fast. You have to go to JD.com to buy things.
Not so good
JD.com just can’t do it. One of the speakers broke after just a few days of use. Friends who want to buy it should be cautious!
3+2 cookies and Mengniu sour yogurt are my favorites^^
It uses up the battery too quickly and is really inconvenient. I can play it for basically two hours.
Not bad? But the power button needs to be pressed harder
Mr. Mengniu is so diligent! The fruit pieces are so awesome!
"The machine is easy to use, the size is just right, the sound is powerful, but the battery is a little weak! All in all, it is a good machine that deserves to be owned!"
"It looks ok, I'm still figuring it out."
"It's cost-effective, and there's no lag at all when playing. You won't know the standby time until you use it for a while. Overall, it's pretty good. It's still fine for children to play with."
Boycotting Mengniu is more reliable than boycotting Japanese products.
"The screen was a mess, but later I found out that I could get it for 800 in a physical store"
"Mengniu has excellent c, always active and always young, @??"
"I just received the goods and played with them for a while. It feels good. The deliveryman delivered the goods quickly. In particular, JD.com’s customer service is very good."
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it, and there was no price protection at all. Negative review"
"As a domestic brand, Huawei has really good quality and is a particularly good helper for my work."
"The order I placed this morning was collected in the evening, and the delivery speed was really fast! The tablet is also very easy to use and the kids like it very much, but I didn’t see the invoice."
"It has feel, speed and texture, in one word: great!"
pit. I just bought it yesterday and the price was reduced today. Bad review
The current experience is pretty good.
"The gift leather case was not available, but now it is available again. The screen is really small, with wide black borders"
"It’s not very good. There is a conversion camera in the camera. It disappears every time and has to be reset. It’s very troublesome. Moreover, it disappears every time. Now it resets and it doesn’t come back. There is a problem. Bad review."
"The quality is too bad, the speed is super slow, it broke after only a month and a half of use, the worst purchase ever"
I just bought it today and my child really likes it. I will comment after using it.
"If you change your waistcoat, you think consumers don’t recognize it? Tutu, my friend, he drank too much from Mengniu when he was little... Reply Do you believe this? Reply New Mengniu, new changes. http:t.cn/zWBhkvl"
"The small tablet is okay, and the tablet is convenient for making calls."
"There is a bug in the evaluation system, and the attitude is so bad, I hope it goes out of business"
"The price was reduced within 24 hours of purchase, and the customer service was no longer available during evening business hours. If you don’t participate in the price treasure, you won’t get a free gift if it’s full, and I haven’t seen the invoice yet! I will never buy from JD.com again! ! !"
"With fine workmanship and smooth operation, the 64g call version is not just a tablet, it is actually a big mobile phone! Fully functional."
"I have bought at least 10 units. This is the first time I know that they gave me a refurbished machine. After using the machine for more than a month, I found that all the circuit boards inside were rotten. It was so serious that they even went to Huawei after-sales service to repair it."
"I couldn't wait to open it. I'm very satisfied. I received a lot of gifts. After turning on the phone, I upgraded. The speed is very fast. It can be used perfectly in daily life. There is no lag in games. The sound quality is great, I bought it just for watching videos. satisfy"
The three virtual keys at the bottom of the screen flash and have horizontal lines. Contacted customer service and no one responded.
"Very good, JD’s delivery is fast! Really fast!"
"The resolution is a bit low. The key is express delivery. Bad, bad, bad. Wuhan is two and a half hours away from my home, and it took six days to deliver it?"
"The price was reduced when I bought it, and it’s a bit inconvenient that the place where I put the card is not a card slot that can be taken out. But the price/performance ratio is very high and the appearance is very beautiful."
"Very good, the quality is okay"
Actually. . . I still like to drink Mengniu milk. . .
"Bad review, the resolution is too bad, I regret it so much"
"If you’re bored, delete your Weibo, drink Mengniu, and go to bed after you’re done."
"The sound effect is really only average. Compared with the Samsung T800 I traded in 2 years ago, the sound quality and screen display are so far behind that it is not worth it. The only advantages are portability and speed."
"The workmanship is a bit rough, but it's okay to use, relatively smooth, the screen is big enough, and the sim card tray doesn't fit tightly. Fortunately, I bought a mobile phone case."
It's ok but a bit stuck
"Not bad, pretty good"
"Customer service is so bad, ignored many times"
"It's like an enlarged version of a mobile phone. It's slim and long, okay, smooth, and the touch screen is quite sensitive."
"China’s garbage people are always garbage, their logic, garbage’s way of dealing with things, CNN"
There is no human service for rubbish.
There is no problem for now. The power is normal.
"The customer service attitude is good, the shipping speed is very fast, and I was very satisfied with the tablet the moment I opened it. The tablet runs well, the body is thin, and the photos are clear. I am very satisfied."
"As soon as I received it, the screen was not clear and not very bright. When I contacted him to exchange it, the customer said that he could only exchange it for the same model. It was really a lie that the same model was not the same. What else could be exchanged? So it makes no sense to switch without reason."
It's very smooth and will be even better after the system is updated. There is no lag at all when watching movies. Especially the sound is very good.
"Fall in love with Mengniu Youyi C ""Delicious! Great."""
"Smooth, clear, and delicate to the touch, especially the sound effects on both sides are simply cool! ! ! Jingdong Logistics couldn’t say more than one word: “in place”! ! ! The service is also in place, thank you for changing the invoice! ! !"
"Yes, it's authentic."
"I bought a bottle of Mengniu yogurt. It was extremely sinful. This was the only brand. I took it and put it back, but finally I took it. It was so unstable! Next time, make sure you only drink Mengniu!"
This is my fourth time buying Huawei Honor. It is very good and supports domestic production!
"Good quality, good reviews!"
"I bought it for my mother, but I haven’t started using it yet. It ran out of power after a day or two of being fully charged. But when I found out, it was already past the return or exchange period. Bad review."
"I don’t want to say anything, but the price was reduced by 100 only three days after I bought it. Is this making fun of working people’s hard-earned money? When I contacted the supplier, no one responded at all. I no longer have a good impression of JD.com. I might as well*"
Mengniu is just a cow? No compensation for defective milk? What can you do?
It took me a while to evaluate it. The Internet speed is very good and it is very easy to use. The 16G memory is a bit small and is enough for my mother.
My son likes it! Not bad indeed! Support domestic products~! !
"The effect is good, the price is relatively low, very practical, and great value!"
"Less than a month after I bought it, the screen went black and then I couldn’t turn it on anymore! ! ! ! Is it genuine? ? ? ? Please give me an explanation! ! ! !"
"It looks old and is a used second-hand product, but the production date is actually 2014. It was a disappointing purchase."
This is the only way I can give it. Only then do I know why there are so many bad reviews.
Very good. I will come again next time.
"He said: I just read the article you wrote about Mengniu. It was really good. Among the reporters I have seen for several years, I remember your name, and I also know a little fat guy from your place @China Economic Weekly Lu Yongqing"
"The quality is okay, very good, and the test is very fast. I came here to review it after using it specifically. If I don’t understand, I asked the customer service. The customer service attitude is very good?, very good."
"Very good thing, very convenient to use"
Shipping is too slow
"Okay, pretty good. Extremely smooth."
"What the hell, this is my first time buying Huawei. It’s so disappointing. The screen cracked after only a few days. What a quality...disappointment."
"Bought for dad, enough to meet his needs"
"There is no difference between the 32G memory and the 16G one. It is very stuck, the machine responds too slowly, and the screen often goes black after less than a month of use."
"It took more than an hour to boot up on the first day. After that, it was stuck. On the eighth day, it crashed. Haha. Now it either freezes or black screen. It’s so unreliable."
Rubbish Jingdong! Fake Jingdong! Refurbished machines are sold on JD.com! There is no clean garbage Jingdong! Come and see what JD looks like in your eyes!
"garbage, garbage,"
Mengniu is in disgrace...
Channel 2
"Big, so big, really big, too big to be grasped. Thanks for the small gift. I also have the 200G data king card. I like it very much."
"Stay away from Mengniu. It has been proven to be non-toxic! Heehee @ShuFenLin: I can only say that Mengniu is not easy, always living in a hail of bullets. Alas, cherish life and stay away from Mengniu."
The baby likes it very much. The one I bought can make phone calls. I used it all afternoon and it feels good.
The service attitude is very good and the courier is very responsible.
"I want to ask, there are headphones on the three packs, but what about the headphones?"
"The system is very fast, it only takes a few seconds to install an application, the sound quality is very good, and the most comfortable thing is the fingerprint. Maybe it's because I was lucky enough not to experience the frame-dropping effects of other buyers. This was the experience on the first day I got it."
"Compared with the price of 988 yuan, the price-performance ratio is very high, the configuration is basically sufficient, daily operations are very smooth, and there is no lag when playing Honor of Kings."
The quality is too bad
"Logistics is slow, I have to wait for a day"
I bought it for an event. My kids like it. JD.com delivers fast and the service attitude is good.
"The product shipped for the first time had a small scratch, so I returned it. Unexpectedly, I had to exchange three products in a row. Either it had scratches or the front camera was crooked. Compared with the first product, the product was the best. In the end, I had to return it."
Nothing comes with bare metal. Disappointed. The phone is okay.
The battery is so worn out that it can’t be used for a day
"In fact, they are all pretty good. The only problem I have is the customer service. I was also drunk."
"If you hate someone, it's hard to show it. Then just buy this phone, it's totally not worth the price."
"Please don’t post a protective film, bad reviews"
"If someone hadn't given me a gift card, I would never have known why JD.com was always*."
"There was a gift pack in the shopping cart when I bought it, but it was gone after I paid. How deceptive! ! ! A very annoying purchase, but the machine is really good. Logistics is very good!"
"I bought it on June 18 when JD.com was holding an event. It was promised as a gift, but I never received it. I don’t know why?"
Very good very good
I don’t want to give it a single star. This tablet is defective. The smear is so severe that it hurts my eyes after looking at it for a while. I strongly recommend everyone to buy it.
"I bought a problematic phone, and there is often no signal at all. There is no signal on the phone network. Brick."
It's very easy to use. It comes with a leather case. The price is also very good. I like it.
"I bought it as a gift, but I didn’t open it. The packaging is very good. I bought one for my own use before. This time it was several hundred cheaper. The price is so cost-effective. Will the price be reduced in the future? ? ?"
I heard that yesterday's game at the basketball hall of the Sports Institute was very exciting. Thank you Mengniu for sponsoring it and Chengyi Basketball. It's a pity that I didn't go to watch it.
"The delivery speed is still very fast, but I don’t know how to buy the items back home for my sister."
Baby received. Very satisfied with the size. JD.com products are trustworthy
Mengniu is garbage
Mengniu Old Popsicle is very similar to what I ate when I was a kid. .
Bad review! ~~~~
"Drinking wine is equivalent to drinking pesticides. Changyu can no longer be trusted. People who have made mistakes are very likely to make them again, such as Mengniu. Only by shutting down completely can consumers' concerns be dispelled."
You get what you pay for! The brother who delivers the courier has a bad attitude!
"I was so hungry that my stomach kept growling. I had no choice but to crawl out of bed and rummage through the cabinets for food reserves. I found three French breads and a bottle of Mengniu, and I ate decisively."
"Good quality and low price, the boss’s service attitude is very good!"
"The screen brightness is not bright enough, but everything else is fine"
"The logistics is fast, and the tablet looks good. However, the memory is too small. I haven’t downloaded many things before it ran out of memory. Fortunately, I can still insert a memory card."
"The price is average and it works well, so I just give you a review."
"The shopping cart interface is inconsistent with the checkout interface, which may deceive customers."
"When viewing iQiyi horizontally, the progress bar below cannot be clicked."
It's okay. It has been installed. It has not been used. It is still being renovated. I will try it when I move in.
"Used by parents, not bad"
praise
"The tablet works great! Very satisfied, but the protective cover is too difficult to buy! I wonder if Jingdong Mall has it?"
"This point is for JD.com. It’s a scam. When I bought it, the product picture said there was a gift, but after I bought it, it said there was no gift. It also said there were regional differences. I just want to say it’s too scammed. I can only give it a hoot. I advise everyone to read it clearly."
"The function of the actual product does not match the description in the picture. It does not support 4G card for Internet access at all, which seriously deceives consumers. I read the introduction and said that it supports China Unicom's 4G, but it does not even support 2G card."
It’s not bad. It fits well. I like it. It would be perfect if I could give it a case.
"The tablet is good. It’s worth the price. I decided to buy it from Teclast. Fortunately, I didn’t."
"It took me half a month to comment. The network connection of this tablet is very poor, and it automatically shut down twice in half a month. Not very good anyway. Not as good as I imagined."
"In addition to Mengniu kiwi's old yogurt, bright aloe vera. The one I love most is my Yakult,"
"Not bad, I bought it for my neighbor and it’s very cost-effective! Good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"It's very good. I bought it for my mother-in-law. The screen is big and easy to use. Not bad, not bad"
"The Huawei M2 tablet is good, and the sound quality is okay. I bought it during the 618 promotion, but it didn’t come with a film or cover. You have to buy it separately."
"My day. Mengniu, you are so shameless! Positive energy? Damn it, you have the nerve to say positive things?"
"I just received it and I think it's pretty good, but didn't it say that it comes with a film and a leather case? Why do I have nothing?"
"Not bad, I won’t let go of this baby after I buy it. *It’s really a great value after buying it! Watch movies online without any lag at all!"
"Not so good, just average"
"High configuration, good screen, high screen-to-body ratio, 8.4 gold size, just right in your hand. Comfortable for both hands. The pixels are average but sufficient, the battery life is great, and the external sound quality is stunning. Worth the price."
"It has a tall appearance, easy to use, smooth system operation, suitable for entertainment and leisure, fast logistics and exquisite packaging."
"When I turn it on for the first time, it won't turn on or turn off. return the goods!"
"It’s pretty good. I bought it for my grandma. I praise the courier guy! My legs are inconvenient, but they are always delivered to my door!"
"When watching videos or playing games, the screen automatically shuts down."
"No protective case or film included, really!"
"It’s really sad. My phone gets hot before I finish playing a song. I don’t even play with the battery anymore. In the end, I can’t even play the next song. Oh, I regret it."
There is indeed room for further improvement in the details of the system.
"The size is suitable and light, unless playing games, 2G of memory is enough."
Not very satisfied anyway
"Half a month after I bought it, the charging socket started to have poor contact."
My baby has started using it. I like it for its practicality.
"The order arrived today, fast. Please order more next time."
"I am the king of pesticides, they are not stuck at all and they feel good~~"
Very easy to use and the battery lasts a long time
The customer service didn't even reply. The tablet is no different from the Daping mobile phone.
I didn’t expect that the order I placed at midnight would be delivered the next day. The machine is very good. I like it???
Invoice has not been provided yet
"I bought it for an old man, and it works well for him! ! ! !"
What a scam. This phone should obviously be called a phablet. It doesn't come with a phone. It's so deceptive to consumers.
"Alas, I changed it once, and it turned out that this one consumes power faster than the other one, and it also generates heat. The most important thing is that it consumes power quickly and cannot be charged during video... But the courier is very good. This star is given to me. From the courier! ! !"
"It's worth buying this thing at this price, it's enough"
"You cannot apply for price guarantee due to purchase restrictions, so what do you mean by your purchase restrictions? I bought it yesterday and the price dropped after two days*. Aren’t you deceiving me?"
"The earth is so terrible, even Mengniu can’t drink it. If I had known I would marry a cat star!"
"This is called breaking the pot and breaking the pot. . . ! Is Mengniu OK? ! ! If not, just close the door."
"Not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad?"
"I just bought it yesterday, and today the price was reduced by 20, and I paid for it interest-free, with no explanation and no compensation for the difference. Is this really good?"
"I don't have a plug-in card, and it works very well when used in driving schools to practice driving. It’s worth promoting, and the express delivery is fast and very good."
The machine is very stuck. I suggest you be careful. We won’t give you a refund! I even doubt whether it was renovated.
The old man is so domineering. . Mengniu in the video is domineering again!
"Not very good, not worth recommending"
"The screen is pretty good, but there seems to be something wrong with the brightness adjustment! It's probably a system bug. The big black border is a bit ugly, but everything else is good."
I can't even put a protective film on it. Bad review.
Nothing! The call is not clear!
"Garbage, slow charging, more than 500 hours of standby time, liar"
"I promised to send a mobile phone protective case, but it didn’t come out, so it’s a bad review! ! ! ! !"
"It's so disgusting. Less than two months after I bought it, the price was reduced by more than 400 yuan. This is the first time I have encountered such a disgusting thing."
"Good machine, perfect workmanship, support JD.com"
very nice! Quality Bought for my family! ! praise! ! ! Support Huawei!
Support domestic production
The promised inner bag turned into a free-read card. I was also drunk...the customer service is completely unreliable...
"Good stuff, fast delivery, come back often."
"I’ve been using it for a long time before reviewing it. It’s not bad. The screen is medium-sized and feels heavy to hold. It also comes with a protective case, tempered film, plastic mold, and LeTV membership (one year). It’s pretty good. The speed is also very fast."
"Fortunately, I never eat Mengniu."
"Easy to use, thank you Jingdong, this is a very pleasant shopping."
"Not satisfied, not satisfied, not satisfied."
"Average, average, average. . . . . . . . ."
"Bought for a customer, I prefer the domestic ones from Huawei! Fast and timely! Great!"
The resolution is poor in one word!
"This resolution was designed by a dog, right? The speakers are exactly the same as those on her mother’s copycat phone."
"Mengniu's advertising slogan ""Mengniu, just for a little bit of happiness"""
Shipping is too slow
I believe in domestic brands and support Huawei. It looks beautiful and is smooth to use. Children like it.
"The wireless card is terrible, the signal is full, I can’t even use WeChat, it’s all... B/s"
"It’s okay, it’s genuine, why doesn’t 618 hold activities?"
It still feels very good. I must give it a thumbs up. The quality is also very good. The stuff is very good.
"Just after buying it, it changed to 1300. After calling, it said it was 1499. I just blame myself for not taking a screenshot. What the hell? Bad review for JD.com."
"Currently using it, please wait a few days before commenting."
"The pixels are too poor, the touch feel is also very poor, the touch response is too slow, and the sound effects are not satisfactory either."
"If you’re in a bad mood and can’t think straight, just drink Mengniu. . ."
Both the store owner and the delivery person installed it very well. It has been used. It is very good.
"Very easy to use tablet, great old movies"
The tablet is too bad. Charging is so slow that it can't even keep up with the speed of use. I feel stuck after using it for a few days. Slow response. Is Jingdong going to develop towards Taobao quality?
Domestic brands are of good quality and have an advantage in price. I bought them for the elderly and they are very useful.
+1 if this brand absolutely goes out of business in Hong Kong. Rubbish rubbish rubbish awesome rubbish Mengniu! ! ! !
"Huawei (HUAWEI) M3 8.4-inch tablet has smooth system, fast speed, clear screen, fast heat dissipation, Kirin 950 configuration"
"Easy to use, affordable, hahaha, so fast and economical, not bad"
"The delivery was super fast, the size is just right, light weight and not tiring to hold. It runs very smoothly, has good sound effects, and is very convenient for viewing PDFs."
"The resolution is too low, it looks blurry, I regret it"
"Not good to buy, I regret playing games, bad cards, bad reviews."
"Can't make phone calls, other drawbacks are okay!"
"It's only been sold for half a month, it has nothing, and if it breaks, they won't be responsible for repairing it."
The logistics was super slow and I had to wait for six days. The outer packaging was torn open. I don’t know if the package was swapped. This is the most regretful online purchase I have ever made. Worst review
The resolution is really low and the light sensor is rubbish.
I have stopped buying those two brands for a long time! Remind your mothers not to buy them just because they are cheap! Damn it for deceiving the people! Resolutely boycott Mengniu! I hope the country will strengthen its management mechanism! Punish profiteers severely
"Bad review, after-sales service is not good at all! ! ! ! !"
"The appearance of the phone is okay, but the price is expensive and nothing comes with it. Moreover, the power consumption is too fast. I can only use it for a few hours and then it will be gone. I don’t dare to use the phone to listen to music or watch TV. Is it possible that the battery is broken as soon as I buy it? Yes?"
"The phone is good but it doesn’t have a phone film or case, so I’m not satisfied!"
"The tablet feels good in the hand, the screen is clear, and it is very smooth to use. We’ll see what happens next, trust Huawei. ."
"Mengniu, the brand with the most market vitality, gives out prizes when you give money."
"There was an audio problem seven days later, and there was no response after consulting after-sales service."
Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu! wipe! Traitor! What the hell is rejecting Mengniu @???
"Not bad, not bad, but the price was reduced as soon as the purchase was completed. If I had known better, I would have bought it later."
"Yili, Mengniu, Wangzai, Shuangwaiwai, Nutrition Express... various milk drinks were successfully captured by me and I happily sucked them in my office drawer every day!"
"I just used it, and I don’t know how it works. I’ll tell you in a couple of days."
"In use, it feels pretty good."
"Good quality, first-class products, first-class service, very satisfied, Wu'an five-star rating."
"Stupid customer service. I don’t know where the invoice went? I will only say one sentence there: It’s already opened, sb one is still selling cute stuff there, it’s rubbish, the stuff is not good, don’t buy it, please return it!"
"Compare in terms of configuration, price, appearance, and feel. This Huawei tablet is worth buying."
Now I am even more convinced of the reason why I will drink milk in the future. Mengniu is so loving. . I was so happy to see Weibo yesterday. . . @Mengniu micro customer service
The store is bullying customers! ~Liar!
"I bought the wrong Mengniu yogurt at noon and drank it, and I had diarrhea. #If you drink Mengniu again, you will be a fool#"
"The tablet is really not that good. The pixels are too low and the photos taken are not good, especially the clarity and color."
"JD.com is great, the delivery is timely, the price of the mobile phone is great, and the price/performance ratio is unparalleled."
"To be honest, I suspect that this phone is a second-hand refurbished phone. I admit that the camera is good, but other aspects are really rubbish. I can’t hear the sound when making phone calls. The phone is extremely hot and the battery is not durable. I don’t recommend you to buy it."
I placed the order in the morning and it was delivered in the afternoon. It was really fast. I upgraded the system as soon as I turned on the computer. I tried it after the upgrade. The sound effect is really good. I watched a movie and the clarity was pretty good. It supports domestic products.
"It's a bit laggy to use, and it's not very good at playing games."
Now I almost don’t drink Mengniu anymore~ I fainted!
"ok, i like it"
The product was not good and nothing was given. Not even a condom was given
"It's very smooth to use, the screen is very clear, and I haven't encountered the smear problem reported online, but the battery life needs to be improved."
"Jingdong is self-operated, so it shouldn’t be any worse."
I have used it for more than two months before reviewing it. It feels very smooth and worth buying.
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it, so bad reviews. The delivery guy hung up the phone after I pressed him for a moment. What a bad review!"
What rubbish. . . Awesome product. What about 4G?
"It doesn't matter if the resolution is poor, the lag is so laggy that people want to smash it."
Mengniu has undergone some changes recently. It really depends on how they deal with internal challenges. Don’t just talk without practicing.
Don’t drink Mengniu. Don't drink Yili.
I found that Mengniu’s reduced version of the original flavor is also delicious.
Nothing is given. This is JD.com
"The JD.com courier is very enthusiastic, and the tablet has no lag when playing Honor of Kings. Not much else to say, you deserve it."
Not satisfied at all. It has just been 10 days. I fell from the 40cm high bed and the screen of my phone was broken. This model is too parallel. I won’t buy this kind of phone next time
"In terms of price, it meets the usage requirements, is pretty good, and is cost-effective."
"I bought it during a flash sale. I have been paying attention to this phablet for a long time, and the price has never dropped to my psychological level."
"The workmanship is good, but the black frame is a bit larger, but overall it's okay."
"I no longer drink Mengniu, but having said that, if the milk spoils and expires, it is the responsibility of the supermarket, and it seems to have little to do with the manufacturer. Rogue Mengniu. I will kill you if you don’t buy it # Drink Mengniu dies for the whole family # # Drink Mengniu dies for the whole family #"
"It's good to use, but the screen feels a bit small and there are a few accessories. Others are okay."
"The sound is good and the screen is clear. It is very comfortable to use, can be used with pesticides, and is great for watching videos online."
"Generally, it is not recommended to buy if there is no heartbeat feeling."
"Very good, genuine recommendation, great logistics, good reviews"
Much better than expected. Good quality and low price. The kids like it very much.
"Not bad, the price is a little expensive, I bought it for a friend"
"Logistics is too bad! It costs 1 yuan to pick up the items, but the items on JD.com are OK. Buy it to deceive consumers"
Why are there no headphones? Why is the camera biased?
"Bought for a friend, the performance is very good, the price is right, the friend is very satisfied^_^"
You can see my little happiness
"Not worth it, I regret it very much, the screen is not clear, the machine freezes continuously, the price is not cheap, I am very dissatisfied"
"Stop drinking Mengniu ""Secrets of Mengniu's rescheduled milk circulation"" (from http:t.cn/zWmn3zn"
I expressed no confidence that it would be better if it went bankrupt! Especially Mengniu'Yili.
"It's okay, but compared to Xiaomi watches, it's just mediocre."
"It freezes often, the resolution is too low, and it freezes even when watching videos. I don’t need to say how good the quality is."
"It looks okay, but you will know whether it is good or bad after using it. I only use it to watch TV, so there is not much demand. Good reviews"
"Sorry, no gifts. . . . . . . . ."
"A good product from Huawei. The gaming performance is stable, good and smoother."
"I received the phone, but there is something wrong with the screen, which makes me very disappointed! There is a black line in the lower third of the startup screen! Serious quality problems"
Very good can be great
The screen is big and clear. It’s super fun to watch videos and watch TV series. It’s fast and doesn’t stutter.
I’ll review it after using it for a while. It’s a pretty good phone!
Huawei's products so far are really good!
I just want to say that the express delivery is too fast. It arrived eight hours ago and I haven’t used it yet. I think it should be okay. Good quality and low price.
Innovate Mengniu! Conscience Mengniu! Don’t worry about the dairy industry! I was so moved! Hong Kong restricts the purchase of milk powder
"I just bought the phone two months ago and it’s bent like this in my pocket! It’s a ridiculous phone. The screen is not broken, it’s bent like this. The quality of this phone is also awesome."
"I wanted to return it and exchange it for something better, but something happened and it was delayed, which made me depressed. . . . . . ."
"It’s a bunch of useless stuff, so I’ll give it a bad review."
"The battery drains very quickly. Some of the ones I bought on the same day came with headphones, but some didn’t. I felt a little uncomfortable and it wasn’t the first time I bought a mobile phone from JD.com."
"The camera function cannot be used when starting it for the first time, and it works fine after restarting! After restarting, it always stays at the boot interface and cannot be used normally. I have applied to change the machine! ! !"
I just got this phablet phone and haven't used it completely yet. It looks very good. I will review it after I use it.
The resolution is too low. I can't even see the picture clearly. This star is for the courier guy
Not bad. My friends like it very much.
There's a flaw on that metal edge. A piece is missing. Damn it. It's just not obvious.
Fall in love with the taste of Mengniu Youyi C
"The order I ordered yesterday arrived today. The courier guy is really awesome. I haven’t started using it yet. I’m only reviewing it after using it. I wonder why there is no invoice. Logically speaking, the invoice for electronic products should be sent together with the product."
Whoever buys it will regret it
Mengniu’s banana milk…is pretty good too…
"It's great to use. Huawei phones make people feel at ease, and shopping on JD.com makes people worry-free."
Bullshit garbage! ! ! !
"It's very laggy to use, and some words can only be displayed normally if the system is not optimized."
"Very good, quite good! Very good, quite good! Very good, quite good! Very good, quite good!"
The home button fails countless times every day and I don’t even bother to apply for after-sales service. Bad review
"If I hadn't wanted to hear Liang Bo sing one more song, I wouldn't have endured Mengniu's false advertising, Liu Qian's incomprehensible Mandarin, and this boring award ceremony"
"marvelous. . . Exactly the same, I really like it. . . . Especially love. . . . If you like it, hurry up"
Don’t dare to drink Mengniu Yili
This is the first time I bought something from JD.com and I am not satisfied with it. The upper left corner is light. I applied for a return but I don’t know if anyone will come to receive it! ! I will never buy anything from JD again!
"Very good, the screen is big enough, it’s cool, but it’s a pity that I broke the sticker"
"There are no headphones, and the waiter's attitude was not good when I asked. If I hadn’t come here to give it away, I would definitely return it!"
"It says it will give you a high-definition tempered film, but it won’t give you one. That’s a lie."
The Huawei tablet was so bad that I gave it away immediately after buying it.
"The Internet speed suddenly stopped while connected to wifi, and the wifi outage was particularly serious."
"The memory usage is too much, and there are only a few G of memory left, which is quite satisfying."
"Very good, fast and cheap, worth buying"
It's bad when you buy it
It’s the first time I buy something on JD.com. It says there are gifts but I don’t give anything. The customer service is so stupid that you push me and I push you. They all say they are only responsible for pre-sales.
Satisfied as always. I was very impressed when I received the machine. It is exactly as described in the product information.
"I would like to ask, is your system human-made or automatic? Are you sure it is accurate? ! Three customer service staff gave me three advices, which one should I listen to? I just want to issue a usable invoice, why is it so difficult!"
"Received it quickly, very good! ! !"
satisfy! The screen is big enough! Enough power
The phone feels good and the screen resolution is high. I like it very much.
"I didn’t receive my LeTV membership card. I have to return it if I want to return it. It’s disgusting. Also, the camera is really rubbish and the operating system is hard to use."
"Yes, the 8.4-inch large screen can be used as a mobile phone. Will evaluate after using it for some time"
"Just arrived, not installed yet, good reviews"
"It feels good, and the picture is also very good. I have always supported JD.com, but now that it has become bigger, some small details have not been done well."
Mengniu apologizes
"I don’t like it, the battery is not enough!"
Good buy for the elderly
It’s okay. I bought ten units and the price dropped in two days.
It feels good in the hand and is very cost-effective
It's too slow to use and I regret buying it!
"The screen is very stunning. Watching 2k videos is a blast, and the tuned sound effects are great. It is the first choice for audio and video. The system is smooth, not inferior to Apple's iPad. Support Huawei."
"It was broken as soon as I got it back. The screen went black as soon as I opened the app. I contacted customer service to send it for repair. I’m sure it’s not a joke. Damn it, this is Huawei. It’s a scam. Dad, 1588."
Jingdong's third-party sellers are no different from Jingdong's self-operated sellers. This is particularly unkind. Or JD.com wants to make profits from it.
Already purchased many times.
Marhaba’s milk tea uses Mengniu pure milk to ensure the quality of the milk tea.
It's pretty fast. I don't know if the battery is enough. It's good.
A relatively cost-effective computer
I've been using it for two days and it feels fine.
JD.com is great. I used to buy it in physical stores and it was hundreds of dollars more expensive. Now I just buy electronic products on JD.com.
What can I say? The machine will freeze. But the service is very good. Returned
The boss of Mengniu is so domineering!
Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu
"That's it. I didn't see how good it was, just average."
"#Christmas EveHow to spend it# I’m not in the mood. If I miss Mengniu’s re-examination, it doesn’t count as a miss. It’s my own choice."
"Okay, I’ve played it, it’s very good, worthy of Huawei."
"The earphones that were promised were not delivered, and they were said to be on a first-come, first-served basis... This is the first time I encountered such a thing on JD.com..."
"Pay tribute to Jiaduobao, Sunrain Solar, Site Wine, Mengniu and other unknown companies. I would also like to thank those unknown production teams for presenting us with scenes of truth, goodness and beauty!"
My son can come and listen to the music
"The price was reduced not long after I bought it, I’m really upset -_-#"
I was really surprised when I opened the box. It's quite beautiful and feels more refined than the iPad.
"Logistics is fast, very good, the size is just right. Feels good too"
Mengniu has been shot countless times. It’s been almost a year since we boycotted Mengniu. Mengniu Popsicle is also pretty good. You can't eat old popsicles either. Does anyone know if Baxi and Lu Xue are safe?
"It's fast, easy to use, and quick to operate, but it's not the best, but overall it's very good."
Where has my invoice gone? Where has my invoice gone?
"A good tablet, ok for daily use, supports Huawei"
Bad review. Too bad. Don’t buy it.
"Haven't used it yet, will review after using it. The baby seems to be very good. It is genuine and it is a small electrical appliance given by the shop owner. Thank you."
"I thought it was good when I bought it, but now after using it for a few months, the battery is no longer working. It loses 20% of its power after a day of standby."
To JD customer service. After sales. . . The after-sales service is generally not satisfactory.
"The picture is clear, the sound quality is good, and there is no lag. Worth buying"
"The charger didn't work after I bought it. I ordered it for a colleague. He thought it would be troublesome to return it, so he spent money to buy a charger from the store. The express delivery was pretty good, but the product received a bad review."
"Bought as a birthday present for my dad, he loves it."
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
The boss is nice and the stuff is nice too.
"Moderate size, smooth operation, clear screen, good sound quality, sensitive touch screen, overall elegant, I like it."
Japan is really rubbish and the motherboard broke after three months of use.
"It's really average, the length-to-width ratio is uncoordinated, and the black wide borders on both sides are really not designed well."
"The experience is good, but the battery is not very powerful! The battery life is average, of course, it depends on how you use it. Overall satisfied"
"Good quality and cheap, worth owning"
"I don’t know how the product is, but the delivery person just threw it into the security room. What should I do if someone else takes it away?"
"Not bad, not as big as expected, maybe it’s a matter of my personal understanding, but overall it’s still very good!"
Where did JD send my goods?
"I have always loved Mengniu, but I decided to buy it because of @ Liuxiang. The point is, if you buy two cups, you’ll get one for free."
The stuff is good. . . . Support domestic products. Good reviews. .
"I really want to support domestic products, but domestic products are so weak! If you really love life and stay away from Mengniu, can you still drink domestic milk? Terensu also fell"
"Very good, very good. After using it, it feels no worse than Apple’s"
"The tablet is very good, the logistics is super fast, I am satisfied"
Not clear! The touch is not sensitive! WeChat cannot be downloaded! Not worth it
"The 16g memory shows about 12g...the resolution is not as good as I said...ah, I really feel like I have been cheated."
"The reputation of JD.com’s self-operated store is trustworthy, and the delivery service is excellent. I give it full marks and will continue to purchase it in the future."
"Supporting Huawei has its shortcomings, but the shortcoming is that it is too perfect."
"I bought it for my dad~~~*~~~I didn’t know that JD.com has a price protection service. I missed the seven-day application deadline and finally returned it to me. I don’t know how it was. Anyway, it was really fast~~~ Not bad. Worth recommending"
"Because there was no stock in Sichuan, I had to wait two or three days for the goods to be transferred from other places. The baby is very satisfied. This is the third one. I will come back in the future. I support domestic products."
The tablet is too bad and I can’t return it.
"I was working out at the gym today and accidentally tasted Mengniu Guanyi milk~ It tastes good~ I’ll try it if I have time~ I originally had photos, but I’ll post them another day!"
"Jingdong’s customer service is really bad. I have to charge *yuan for a haircut? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The phone doesn’t have 1300 pixels, and it’s not as good as Samsung’s. The screen contact is not sensitive enough. Sometimes order several times."
Things are good and useful
"The product is very good, the delivery is fast, the service is very good"
"It’s so easy to use, I have to play it every night before going to bed"
Huawei M3 is my favorite mobile phone. I have always used Huawei mobile phones and support domestic products.
Please check the after-sales service before buying.
"There's no manual or invoice, so what's the standard? What more five-star reviews are needed!"
"It sucks. There are no headphones, cases, etc. that are mentioned as gifts."
"The data cable was broken when I got it and couldn't be charged. The customer service didn’t change, so I gave it one star, which is already very respectable."
I haven’t drank Mengniu for a long time.
"Hmm... You are not normal consumers. I don’t eat meat products from Shuanghui, I don’t drink Yili and Mengniu, and now I won’t drink any domestic red wine or white wine. I wonder if I am qualified and normal?"
"Bought for a friend, logistics is super fast"
What Mengniu executives did after they withdrew from Mengniu has become very low-key and popular recently!
"Just received it, I can only tell the quality after using it. I hope the quality of the merchant is good and I will introduce friends to buy next time"
Very good! Lightweight!
Very disappointed with Huawei's attitude towards solving the problem! ! ! ! ! ! !
Huawei products are guaranteed! ??
"The logistics speed is fast, the packaging is also good, the response is very fast, and the battery is durable. It would be great if the camera has a flash. Overall, it is good value for money, supports domestic production, and supports Huawei!"
"Mengniu, you are so talented. . Look at how scared you are of Brother Fortune!"
Fall in love with Mengniu Youyi C
"So-so, you just can't make phone calls. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Mengniu has also released cylinder packaging. . . Still paper. . . So beautiful
"Beautiful Mengniu new packaging, finally changed the avatar, Yili Mengniu is easier to distinguish!"
The stuff I gave you was rubbish and useless.
The phone is very easy to use. It is brand new when I receive it. The packaging is intact and complete. It feels very good. I support it.
"With decisive support, Mengniu is still great."
"Overall, I'd give it a 9, with one point deducted for the sound effects."
"The phone is good. I have been using it for two months. However, the VLP function of Oriental Fortune cannot be used. I called Huawei and Oriental Fortune and couldn’t find a solution."
The cows at Mengniu Cattle Farm are very powerful == Have you really seen it? ? Teenager forward Weibo
"Not bad, I like it very much, support Huawei, JD.com is trustworthy"
"The 7-inch is too big to hold, but that’s okay. It is very comfortable to use, very convenient, very valuable, and cost-effective!"
Screen resolution is too poor
"I received the tablet and am quite satisfied with it except that the memory is a bit small. The only dissatisfaction is that if you order the front foot, the price will be reduced for the rear foot. The battery life is good, and it can last a day on a full charge. It's just that my eyes can't stand it."
"The logistics was fast, but the appearance of the machine was damaged. The outer strips were deformed and it felt like it had been dismantled."
"You guys are so dishonest. I bought something on February 29th and you sold it for * yuan cheaper on March 1st. It’s so sad. I bought a Huawei Honor tablet for *, and now you’re selling it *."
"Nothing was delivered or told, and there was no invoice. I was a bit worried about the quality."
The screen is big and the sides are small. It looks very beautiful and can be used as a tablet.
"It's very good, and Huawei has guarantees, supports domestic production, and strives to surpass Apple and Samsung as soon as possible. However, the customer service is so bad that no one cares about anything they say."
"The resolution is too low. It is incomparable with the Xiaomi tablet. I used * and bought it at a loss. I bought this piece of junk. If I had known better, I would have bought Teclast."
"The screen is too big, which makes me uncomfortable. . . . . . . . . ."
"When I purchased it, the page showed that there were gifts, but when it arrived, there were no gifts. I asked customer service and the answer was ""While supplies last"". Call him a liar and he doesn't admit it?"
I just bought a bag of high-calcium milk from Mengniu. I drank it and regretted it a bit.
"Fast delivery! High-end atmosphere, support Huawei! !"
"This one is okay, relatively affordable"
The sound quality is great. Watching movies on the 2k screen is very shocking. I support Huawei and hope it will get better and better in the future |????)
"It's very easy to use, and the fonts are large for my father, so it's very convenient."
"Rubbish, please don’t buy it"
Five-star quality! Huawei is trustworthy!
"It feels pretty good so far, the speed is pretty fast and clear, and watching videos is smooth. Hope it stays well"
wipe! Rubbish Mengniu!
"A gift for my family, but it has not been used yet. I support domestic products and trust Huawei. The price of 618 is very exciting! Trust JD.com!"
"Wow, Mengniu’s software development jobs are pretty good, with automatic replies and great search capabilities. But it doesn’t matter. What matters is your quality and reputation. Niu Niu, what do you think? @ Mengniu micro customer service @ Mengniu Dairy"
"Customer service is too bad, very bad"
There are no problems with the use of the equipment. It is still in use. I hope there will be no problems in the future.
"I have been using it for a week before reviewing it. The response speed is okay, but the video is a bit blurry and the image is not very clear."
Is it possible that Mengniu will go bankrupt?
My uncle took it back to his hometown and used it for more than a month. He often couldn't hear the sound when he called! What a disappointment!
"White screen with bright spots, so rubbish"
"It can sleep intelligently, the sound quality is good, the speed is okay, and it's not enough for playing games, but it's enough for daily use."
"You can eat a piece of Mengniu pudding for 1 yuan, as long as you are not afraid."
"I just bought it. If you cut the price by 200, I'll kill you. What are you doing? . Play with me. . ."
"Good product, you can buy it with confidence"
"The quality of Huawei is very good. It is fast, smooth, the battery is durable, and the logistics is also fast. Like it."
I've been using it for a while and it's pretty good. The battery is very durable.
"This product is not bad, the running memory is okay, but the memory is a bit small, but overall it is still a very pleasant purchase"
Cell phone battery doesn’t last a day
The configuration is average and I bought it for my children.
The tablet is very cost-effective and Huawei’s quality is trustworthy.
I only drink Guangdong brands Yantang and Xiangmanlou for milk. I never drink Yili Mengniu. I can’t understand why this kind of heartless company hasn’t closed down yet.
Push it up! ! ! I have long since asked my friends and relatives not to buy Mengniu and Yili. Everyone votes with their feet. This kind of unscrupulous enterprise cannot survive. Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu!
"Regarding after-sales service, I hope JD.com can put itself in their shoes and think about it. If they are a customer and the goods they buy are returned due to quality problems, the customer will have to bear the losses. Is it acceptable for such after-sales processing results?"
The courier was dispatched at 2pm and it was delivered at 4pm the next day. It was promised to arrive on the 30th but it turned out to be the 31st.
"The delivery was fast, but the low-end version doesn’t have headphones, which is a bit disappointing. Evaluate after experiencing the specific details."
"When I bought it and opened it, I found that the back was extremely dirty and the battery was very weak. I was very dissatisfied."
Received bad reviews about the screen with fingerprints
"I bought it as a 38th anniversary gift for my mother. I used it for 2 months before reviewing it. I am very satisfied with it. It is relatively light, practical and smooth."
"Should I change Ainima? Anyway, I won’t buy any Mengniu products. Isn’t this just changing the soup without changing the medicine?"
"In fact, after using it for less than two months, something went wrong. I just made a phone call and didn’t even log in to WeChat. It’s a crappy machine."
"This is my favorite yogurt, but if it has Mengniu on it, I don’t want to buy it anymore."
I bought my phone just over a month ago and it won’t turn on. Then the test showed that there is fluid accumulation. This is not a refurbished phone. This is so disappointing.
"There is no way to issue an invoice. Are there so many problems with issuing an invoice? What kind of business license do I need to upload? What the hell, I’m so annoyed. The customer service asked me to go to the JD customer service robot, but it didn’t work. I’m very angry."
"People who are like pigs sell products like pigs, white tablets with black shells, does that insult the intelligence of consumers?"
"Bad review, it is recommended not to buy it"
"After using it for a month, there is no pressing or falling. The screen is already damaged and has two light spots."
"It’s unscientific to reduce the price by RMB 100 if you haven’t bought it for a month, and you won’t make up the difference."
"Yes, the children had fun. Children today are so happy. In the past, we could only play with mud and so on..."
"Not bad, haha. Smaller than expected. Production date 1703, okay. Black borders are acceptable"
"The appearance is beautiful, the system is OK, but the battery is a bit low. The game ran out of battery after about 5 to 6 hours. I only reviewed it after using it for three days."
I’m very suspicious of JD.com. I just bought it and it’s gone by RMB 100 a week. I’m very disappointed.
We should support domestic production.
"After a few days of use, the screen went black and the phone couldn't be turned on. I bought it for an elderly person and was really speechless. . . . . It's obviously a refurbished second-hand phone. . . tell me what to do"
"After using it for a few days, it still feels good, but the big black border is a bit awkward~~Master Lu’s benchmark scores say it’s not bad, the price-performance ratio is quite high, it should be fine after two or three years of use, haha"
It's quite useful for me to watch TV series.
"It's a junk phone. The screen cracked after less than a week of use. When I asked customer service, they were told that there was no warranty. Moreover, when I bought the phone, they didn't even put a screen protector on it, only a charger and a bare phone. . . . . . . . ."
The water heater has been collected and installed. It looks pretty good. I will review it after using it for a while. The gifts given by the seller are also good.
I bought Mengniu yogurt by mistake and decided to throw it away and refused to drink it. It was so shameless. I imitated Guangming’s packaging and put it together with Guangming’s. It was extremely shameless! @mengniudairy
"It runs fast, has excellent sound quality, is fashionable, beautiful, and has high definition. Huawei is a domestic brand and my favorite."
"I bought it for an event, but it turned out not cheap at all. I'm a liar."
#??share# Mengniu made a mistake when it changed its advertising slogan for the first time in 13 years? Mengniu changed its advertising slogan for the first time in 13 years and made a mistake? --- http:t.cn/zl0vyY3
"One star is for Jingdong Express. I am speechless. There are no gifts or anything else, but the electronic invoice I chose! Alas, JD.com is becoming less and less powerful!"
"Not bad, not bad, still pretty good"
"I bought it for someone else, the express delivery was really fast, I received it the next day. The phone is really big."
"The packaging was very crude, and I didn’t wrap it up. Aren’t I afraid it would get damaged? Nothing came, not even headphones. I was a little disappointed. The speed was very fast, and it arrived the next day."
"The battery was very powerful at first, but it lasted a long time, and now it only lasts a day or two."
I have stopped drinking Mengniu for a long time! ! ! Our family has stopped drinking Mengniu for a long time. I have always drank from Tianyou. Mengniu is a pseudo-national enterprise. How can it take Chinese consumers seriously? Mengniu? Is it deception?
"Yes, cost-effective"
"Mengniu breakfast issued by Air China! It’s so cruel, even those who bought discounted tickets can’t be let go!"
The stuff is good. It looks high-end. I bought it for my mother. I’ve watched the news enough. The delivery speed is still as fast as ever.
Huawei products are of high quality and trustworthy!
The item has been received. I like it very much. The only drawback is that there is no screen protector film. The same thing happened when I bought a mobile phone last time. I hope I can also bring the screen protector film in the future.
"Slow logistics, bad attitude, bad reviews, very, very bad"
It looks good so far and the response is quick. It’s just that the packaging is a bit rubbish this time.
"No, there is not much actual memory left in the system. It becomes slow after a few days of use. Moreover, all the gift items are gone. The friends who took the photos together have mine, but I don’t have them. I keep them privately."
Please don’t buy refurbished ones. Everything on JD.com is refurbished. The one I bought has music from 2012 on it.
"After applying the film, I found that the upper right corner was uneven. I was disappointed. But it has already been taken apart. I don’t know if I can return it."
"I forgot to thank you, Sister Mengniu."
"I hope Jiaduobao will not end up like Mengniu, the former sponsor of Hunan Satellite TV’s Super Girl."
"Fortunately, there are too many built-in applications. There is no after-sales service for the flash machine yet."
The speed is very fast. The price is perfect. Like it.
I’m not very satisfied with my purchase. The sound is very low. I received the LeTV membership as a gift. I can’t redeem it at all. I don’t want to give it a single star.
Mengniu is COFCO’s plaything and has been destroyed.
This is the second time I bought a mobile phone from JD.com. I will stick to physical stores in the future.
Can. . . . . . . . . . . . .
"I'll try Mengniu Ice Brick, I don't know how it compares to Guangming's."
"It’s not easy to use, not easy to use at all!"
It’s a great machine. It’s well configured and fun to play. I’ve been paying attention to it for a long time and finally took it.
"The goods have been received, the logistics speed is very fast, it is a very pleasant shopping"
"It's so heartless. . . It means that Mengniu is darker than cut cake, heavier than cut cake, and more expensive than cut cake."
"What the hell, after a month there is no sound when making phone calls and sending WeChat messages. You have to plug in headphones to use it. Not recommended."
"Not bad, very good, affordable, I like it!"
"The phone was discounted by 300 when I bought it, then it was discounted by 400 after a few days, and after a few days it was reduced by 600. The difference in mobile phone prices is less than 10 days. It’s such a big change. It’s really hard to compliment!"
"After Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 came out, I decided to choose Huawei M3. It performed very well in all aspects. When the next generation comes out, I will still choose Huawei."
"The memory card that was sent was useless, it didn’t even have one, and the resolution was really mediocre."
"Bad reviews, they say everyone will be given headphones for free, but in fact they are not given at all. Don’t write a message, the advertisement is ambiguous and misleads customers."
Can only one SD card and SIM card 2 be installed? What is dual-SIM dual-standby called? It’s different from what I understand
"Too cheap, no good goods, slow response"
"A very satisfying purchase, much better than I expected! Support domestic production! !"
Huawei is getting better and better! Highly recommended!
"It is not as powerful as the Youth Board seven-inch tablet. Personal opinion, I would be afraid of trouble if I want to switch."
good! very good.
"This is LW, I look forward to winning an award for my art~ Dear children, is it easy to guess the lineup of the 5th Mengniu Sour Yoghurt Music Chart Newcomer Ceremony, which will be gradually revealed, so please continue to pay attention!"
Very good baby
"I haven’t drank Mengniu for many years! Unscrupulous dairy industry ~ boycott until death! ! Under the banner of ""national dairy industry"", you are harming people's health, why don't you just die! @ pat food safety"
"See you every day for happiness and savings, and go to JD.com for being diligent and thrifty."
"Very bad, only mobile phone, no headphones."
"Bad review! Bad review! Bad review! As soon as I received the product, I discovered that there was a water spot on the backlight of the screen. I asked customer service and had to have it tested by myself before I could return or exchange the product. It’s too troublesome to bother with, and I’m speechless about JD.com!"
"I used it for a few days to evaluate it, and I really like the large screen and practicality."
very good
"Not good, low value for money"
"There is no protective film or leather case, it’s just too ordinary."
I drank oatmeal yellow peach flavored yogurt again. It was really delicious. The oatmeal had a crunchy texture. It was a pity that it was from Mengniu. I couldn’t buy it to drink too much.
"The screen is not responsive 10 days after I bought it. I read on the Huawei forum that many people had problems with the screen not working, the game direction not working, and sliding instead of clicking. Mine is the same. I want to apply for a return or exchange."
"The screen size is suitable, the hand feel is very good, the appearance is also very beautiful, and the dual 4G network speed is also very good"
"Haha, I think back then the Mengniu yogurt popsicles were served with little snowflakes~~~I love eating ice cream in winter, especially when it snows."
"Huawei's products are made well, even though the price is not low!"
I placed an order at 22:00 last night and received the goods at 9:30 this morning. JD.com’s logistics is fast. I really like Huawei’s tablet.
"It's okay so far, and it's worth the price."
"Bought during the 618 event, great value for money, the Huawei system is easy to use, and a very satisfying purchase"
"Nice looking, beautiful, thin and light. The touch screen sensitivity feels a bit high. Others are still being explored, but the sound quality is good."
"Watching the video, when you press the bezel with your hand, the screen will go black. It’s such an amazing machine. Please give it a negative review. People everywhere say how good Huawei is. It seems that I am still disappointed with domestic products!"
I won’t buy Mengniu anymore.
Very good buy for my kids
"Although it is a product from two years ago, the configuration looks very good today, especially the software is relatively practical."
"Without the manual, the SD card cannot be installed in the dual card. Foolish!"
I didn’t read the details and bought it wrong. I thought it could use 4G Internet access.
"Very good, I like it very much. It would be more perfect if it comes with a protective cover."
The price dropped as soon as I bought it. . I really don’t want to say anything more. The stuff is actually pretty good. It’s just that the price can’t withstand the plunge.
"Dongben is good, the speed is very fast, and the price is also cheap when buying for events. Mainly, Jingdong has fast delivery."
"The appearance is clean, the body is small, and the 7-inch size is suitable for carrying in a bag or pocket."
One point is for the logistics guy. But the signal of the mobile phone is really bad. The mobile phone only has 2 bars of signal. What kind of mobile phone is it?
First time giving a negative review! The price is reduced by tens of yuan two hours after purchase! It seems that JD.com can’t come back! The phone is not easy to use and it gets very hot after using it for a while!
Jingdong Express is really not a boast. . . Used it the next day.
"Ah, is Mengniu also qualified?"
How stupid and flattering are you to say such a thing! I guess Mengniu drank too much. .
good
Pretty good stuff!
"Good, very good, very good. Who says domestic brands are bad? The domestic ones are better. They are much better than the air I bought before."
"Well, I’m glad you all got the reply. Look at the actions! Mengniu has made some changes recently. It really depends on how they deal with internal challenges. Don’t just talk without practicing."
"I received the tablet. It's great for watching TV, but the memory is a bit small."
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Actually, just watch the video, the sound effect is really good, and the gifts are also good."
"Mengniu’s new gadget doesn’t taste very good, it tastes like popsicles, and it’s still sold for 11 yuan"
"What a scam. Just for the instant sale, you can get it cheaper than the instant sale*"
"The screen is blurry, the sensitivity is poor, and the window that keeps popping up for you to download is, in short, garbage among garbage. I can't read books, play games, or see pictures. Because there are always pages popping up! !"
I have been using Huawei mobile phones and they work well. I believe the same goes for tablets.
"The price is very cheap, very thin, and the screen is very clear"
"There is no film on the tablet, but it is included in your gifts. Why not just put it on it? Do you plan to let me practice the film application technique?"
"I bought it at night and it was on sale the next day. Fortunately, the price was guaranteed. Also, the customer service is not as enthusiastic as before. Please give it a good review."
"So damn wicked, I will never drink Mengniu again!"
The tablet is great and easy to use.
"Good product, but the size is a bit small"
"It feels good in hand, the sound quality is great, and it’s enough for daily use."
Fast delivery. The tablet is in the process of being upgraded to your home. I will review it after using it!
Mengniu new packaging. . . So beautiful
The speed is good. I used to use Lenovo. This time the flash sale is 1249. It’s a good deal. I can play games without lag. It’s much faster than my phone. The memory is 16g but it’s a bit small. But I’m still very satisfied. I’ll add more after using it for a while.
"The product is beautiful, runs smoothly, and has good picture and sound quality"
"There is something wrong with the quality, the screen went black just 5 days ago"
"I'm sorry if I don't give you a bad review. There was a promotion just two days after I bought it. What do you mean? I gave you this and that, why didn't you give it to your wife? ?799, nothing given."
"A very good machine, very cost-effective, much better than other similar products. It is a very happy shopping experience and worth owning! Android can also make calls, which is awesome"
"At this price, I feel like I have been cheated. The support for domestic products is not so supportive. What is the black border around it? I haven’t looked at it since I received it. It cannot be returned after 7 days. Haha, goodbye Huawei tablet."
Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu!
This M3 has a big screen. It’s so fun to play whatever you want! The clear picture of the 2K screen makes people unable to put it down!
"I thought it was okay at first, but within a month, the speaker was probably broken. Whenever the sound came out, it was an extremely harsh zizzing sound, and the volume control still failed. Huawei shouldn't have such bad products"
very good seller
The screen went black after buying it for 2 months. I was told that the screen was broken and I needed to replace it with a new one. I have been using Huawei phones and it feels good. I didn’t expect that the tablet is so bad.
"After using it for more than ten days, I really like it."
Not installed yet. Service is very good.
"It looks good, very thin and delicate. The delivery is very fast. Jingdong is very fast. The quality is also very good. I support it. Domestic."
"Very good, I didn’t disappoint. The customer said it was very good. It took more than 20 minutes to heat up. The packaging is also very good. It’s a good deal and the water temperature is also good."
"It’s not easy to use, runs slowly, and even exits automatically."
The boss is very nice and the attitude of the installation technician is also very good. 5 points.
"It supports domestic products, but it’s a bit stuck, which doesn’t affect the excitement of the game. It’s worth it for this price."
"There are no earphones and no protective film. After receiving it, I opened the phone and it showed 40% battery. . . disappointment. . ."
"I like it so much. Huawei is so awesome. If I’m an old user, I won’t say much. I will buy Huawei again."
well. . . . . .
"It’s just a transitional product, with a big black frame and no advantages."
It’s good to buy it for the second time
"Yes, Huawei is good"
"Huawei tablets are cost-effective, JD.com logistics is super fast, and the couriers are also very enthusiastic! !"
"The second thing is the attitude. When it was delivered, the courier guy didn't even call and just threw it away. Anyway, bad review."
Mengniu! My favorite. . .
Mengniu milk is very delicious.
Reply How can you make MM feel so embarrassed? Choosing Mengniu is like knowing that drugs are poisonous but still can’t help but buy them and drink them.
"Very dissatisfied, the phone is very hot. Returns are very troublesome, JD.com’s self-operated products are so bad"
"Mengniu's pure milk has been my favorite for more than ten years. Although the packaging has changed, the familiar taste remains unchanged. Haha it's a bit like advertising. But I just want to express my dedication to taste."
Rubbish! Tasteless! Not worth buying!
It's time to throw away the garbage. . . . . ~~
"The stuff is good, the configuration is very good, the appearance is beautiful, and the delivery is fast, but it is a little frustrating that I can't swipe my card at checkout!"
"I bought it for my niece and I like it very much. In addition, compared to my Ipad Mini, this tablet is incredibly cost-effective!"
"Reply I think there are too many egg advertisements. D: If you recognize this chicken, its essence is guaranteed! ! ! Mengniu NULL-1 Please drink Mengniu brand pure milk"
"Okay, okay, I like it"
I bought this for my dad. He likes it very much. He no longer needs to wear glasses to chat on WeChat.
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it. I was also drunk. I bought the leather case and shell myself. After buying it, they were given away. The key is that the tempered film is still rotten."
"The resolution is not good, very grainy and not clear. The price is actually not cheap either"
It’s not bad. The delivery is also relatively fast. I bought two at one time and it’s not bad.
It's a good product. I read a lot of reviews before buying it. I hesitated for a long time between this one and mi3. I finally bought this one. It's great to watch the video and I don't feel any smearing.
It's too bad. I don't want to give anything at all. I won't return it even after one night. I'm stuck playing King of Glory. I'm stuck playing everything. laji. laji
"It feels good. It's a large screen phone, not a tablet."
"Huawei products, 9 out of 10 have cracked screens!"
"Good, good, easy to use. The response has been good. Do we really like Huawei? ????????"
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
The price-performance ratio is good. It’s a thousand-yuan tablet. I’m quite satisfied with Huawei’s quality workmanship and system fluency. It’s generally used by the elderly without any problem.
"Mengniu Yili is the most unreliable. Damn, I just bought Mengniu’s yogurt two days ago and I drank a lot of it. . I have stopped buying any Mengniu products for a long time."
"Not bad, very good. Jingdong Express is awesome."
"It's fast, the screen is clear, it's great for watching movies, and it's smooth for playing games"
"The stuff is really good, good-looking, affordable, and the quality is absolutely guaranteed"
"Very good, smooth, good sound effects, great"
I vow not to buy any products from Mengniu and Yili and destroy them!
The quality and delivery speed of the promotional items are really tiring. I have to wait for a month. Defective products!
"It's okay, not bad, I'm satisfied. I haven't used it yet. I'll take a look after using it."
"The data cable is broken and cannot be charged. The merchant's response is slow and the attitude is not very good, which makes people feel insecure."
I have been using the tablet for a few days and it is very easy to use. At least it is good for watching videos and playing small games.
It feels like it’s not easy to use. Jingdong is not as good as before.
"It's been a long time since I've been here, and it's good to play games."
"The tablet itself is good, and the standby time and usage time are both okay. The resolution is pretty good too."
"I bought it for my mother, but it couldn’t be charged the first time. Then it got better. Now it’s been less than a month and it still can’t be charged. I really don’t dare to buy electronic products online in the future!"
"A good tablet, the touch screen is very sensitive, the screen is clear and beautiful."
"Oops, don’t buy it, everyone. Always shutting down. Playing games is also lagging. Watching movies is ok."
Foreign countries basically don’t check it because they don’t drink Mengniu!
"After dinner, I took out Yogurt and magically discovered the highlight: the spokespersons for Yili and Mengniu Yogurt drinks are actually Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai... Yuanfang, what do you think? ………"
"Huawei mobile phones are good, they support domestic products, and the delivery is fast"
I got it on the 15th and it’s only today that I reviewed it. It’s very good. The video is very good. The picture quality is 720p and 1080. The sound is very good and it feels great. But the price goes off quickly. I lost 200 in less than a week after buying it.
I just got it and half of the memory is gone. It’s so frustrating.
"It’s really a speechless product, but it actually sells for more than 500! The resolution and information processing responsiveness are simply disgusting!"
"The stuff is very good. In fact, everything on JD.com is pretty good! I used to buy things on JD.com, but now I buy them on JD.com. I just want to play one yuan to grab the treasure and give me the winning points! I have played hundreds of games and have never won! I am very poor! hehe"
I just bought it and the price was reduced. It comes with nothing except the charger. The response is super slow. I don’t recommend buying it.
"The logistics was very fast. I took it for two days to play with and then reviewed it very well. Also, the courier guy’s service attitude is great!"
Cell phone is not very good
The goods were exactly as I imagined and the delivery was beyond my imagination!
"Mengniu's real fruit, beautiful and innovative."
"First of all, thank you to the JD Logistics guy, who is very, very responsible and personally delivered it to me after I get off work! ! Support Huawei, no worse than Apple! ! The acoustics are very, very good! ! ! I hope JD.com will continue to do well as always"
"One tastes like Sanyuan, and the other tastes full of chocolate. Neither of them can keep up with Mengniu Yili’s classics, but the box is pretty~"
"The black borders are quite big, but I can accept it. The speed is still good. The main point is that compared to other tablets, its signal is better. Overall, it is good."
"Don't let people write good things in their reviews, and let people choose whether to do it or not. I didn’t like this kind of shopping and didn’t want to use IOUs, so I paid the money and returned it to me."
"It's so-so. I really can't compliment the resolution, it's so blurry! After all, you can't buy anything good for just a few dollars. I plan to switch to an IPAD at the end of the year."
"The worst, worst, worst shopping experience self-operated by JD.com."
"It’s the same thing, but the gap is so big, I feel like I’ve been cheated! I hope you will place orders from other websites!"
"I bought this for someone else, it's very good"
"It runs fast, the fingerprint unlocking is sensitive, the operation is smooth, the screen is clear, and the sound quality is good. Unfortunately, it does not come with headphones, and the battery life is disappointing. JD.com's delivery speed is very fast, and the courier is also very polite."
"Dad likes it very much ~ 16G is enough for my parents. I usually play Landlords, chat on WeChat and watch videos."
"The resolution is not good for watching movies, and charging is super slow. I only charged 50% of the battery in one morning."
"I have been experiencing it since I received the goods. I think it is good and I like it very much, especially the touch screen is very sensitive and I also like the color very much. The mobile phone is also from Huawei. I hope Huawei can produce more good products with excellent quality and support domestic products."
"Very good, very cost-effective"
"The quality is not good. One month after I bought it, it won’t turn on and it freezes."
Already installed and currently in good condition.
It's really fast! Love this one! Internet speed is very fast! Continue to support!
"It's big and the speed is good, but the memory and the second card cannot be inserted at the same time, and the machine's built-in memory is a bit small. Overall, pretty good"
"No problem watching TV, I bought two"
The screen is big and the speed is fast. I bought it for an elderly person and I like it very much!
The speed is super fast. The order placed the night before arrived in the afternoon of the next day. The product is also very powerful. It deserves our praise for our product!
What’s beautiful is good! !
"I just received it, do you know what happened?"
"The mobile phone is good, but the express delivery is not good. The delivery is delivered the next day, and the payment is not made. As a result, the invoice cannot be printed. I have urged customer service, but nothing can be solved. Bad review."
I just received the goods today and the price has been reduced. I feel a little unhappy.
"Junk! ! After using it for several days, I can’t see any pictures on NetEase’s APP news! Reaction is too slow! This is the last domestic machine I bought! !"
"Bought for my daughter, Huawei should be fine"
Really good? Easy to use
"Yes, I trust it to be made in China. The mobile phone is also Huawei. The delivery guy’s service attitude is full of praise."
People who rush to sit on the subway are perfect for advertising Mengniu! Strong Chinese! He trampled off my shoes and pushed me away! His sister
"Not bad, not bad, not bad, really good, really good, hahaha, big brand trustworthy, hahahahaha, not bad, good, good, from"
"Fortunately, I just didn’t deliver what I sent, which is bad faith."
"Convenient tablet, easy to watch movies and read novels"
"It’s so cheap in just a few days, so disappointing. I originally trusted JD.com, but I’m a little moody."
"Big enough, the battery is durable"
Good. Buy for family
"I have bought several m2 tablets, but the prices were relatively high in the past. The flash sale price in this event is very cheap, and the tablets are smoother and clearer to use! Recommended to buy!"
What a big phone. Now you don’t have to worry about my mother being unable to read clearly!
"The response speed is super slow, and sometimes the touch screen does not respond when clicked."
It’s a lie. It’s just a bare phone and a charger. Even the power bank inside was stolen. What a scam.
The price increases* when doing activities. I think it will be cheaper when doing activities. Big liar.
The machine is in good condition and not damaged. The customer service is good. I bought 40 liters and it said it was out of stock. I sent another model with the same function. I like it. I will post pictures after installation. Fast delivery.
Today’s weather coupled with the Mengniu Ice Factory advertisement is a beautiful sight.
"Mengniu exposed trimonitrileamine, so it was replaced by Yili; Yili was found to cause cancer, so it was replaced by Mengniu; Mengniu tampered with the production date of products that were about to expire, and it was replaced by Yili... It seems that I have to go to Hong Kong to buy milk powder for myself..."
It took me a few days to comment. I give this tablet full marks. It runs fast and feels very good.
"The fingerprint scanner doesn't work, the earphones are hard to hear, and the touch screen is sensitive. I'll give this one star to Express."
"Poor, very poor, extremely bad. After using it for less than a month, something went wrong. There was noise in the earpiece, especially when watching movies and listening to music!"
"Not bad, very good, just as described"
"Sorry, I bought it yesterday and the price has been reduced today."
"Not bad, the signal is very good, great device! But after using it for about 2 months, I feel that the screen is not very flexible and feels a bit stuck."
"Just make do! The screen flickers when watching videos, I don’t know why. what do I do?"
A profit-seeking Mengniu manager was detained for tampering with product dates (from http:t.cn/zWRsenA
Bought this for my wife. She said it was ok and not bad.
"The phone jumps randomly for a while, and the music automatically plays, but the music volume keeps jumping."
It's too stuck and hard to use
"The tablet is currently being used well, the system is smooth, and no problems have been found so far. The built-in software is okay and there are not too many, but it doesn’t even come with a film, which is too stingy."
The screen is not clear and I can't play it at all. It's impossible to get a refund. There are still some requirements. It's a scam. Don't buy it.
"I'm still trying it out, and I'm not too familiar with the various functions. I placed the order a little too quickly. There were no gifts, and I needed to buy another protective film. Because of the price, I had to wait until I buy other products later."
"Not bad, very good, for learning, some functions are not turned on, need to be discussed, mainly for children to learn, what kind of card is namo card?"
"Not bad, very good, I don’t know if it will last long!"
My husband bought the wrong one and thought it would be a hassle to not return it. But he was so disappointed. The quality was not good.
Logistics is very fast.
"I’m really not happy about it. I bought it but the screen was broken. Even though I returned it, it took many days. The screen immediately broke down as soon as I charged the new device. It’s a common problem with Huawei’s mobile phone screens. It’s very worrying."
"No, prompt the browser to stop! I applied for a return the next day. . ."
"It's good, I just use it to watch videos, not play games"
"The delivery was overtime. The customer service call also said that it would be delivered the next morning. However, it turned out that the delivery was delivered at night and it was 24 hours late. What is the concept of JD.com's delivery being 24 hours late!"
"It’s a small tablet but a big phone. It looks good, but I don’t know how long it will last."
"Very good, not bad, mainly used for studying, very good. I bought another protective case myself. The price seems a bit expensive."
"Very good, I like it very much, it can be used for a longer time"
"Bad review, bad review! ! ! ! ! Damn, the film was already attached when I bought it. The last WeChat message said that this phone was bound to WeChat. Don’t tell me this is a new phone."
"Not all bugs are called Telunsu. . So disgusting. . It's so disgusting, Mengniu is disgusting, bugs are even more disgusting, and masturbating to bugs is the most disgusting thing! I wipe. . I've been drinking this for the past two days. . . . Never buy again! ! !"
The one I bought last night arrived at noon today. I have to say that JD Express is very fast. I think it's very beautiful and very good. It has 4G of running memory and can be expanded??
"It's not genuine. I used a tablet that my colleague bought in a physical store. There was a difference, but since I had already opened it and couldn't return it, I just used it."
"Bought this for my mom, it’s very useful, she holds it all day long and reads it"
"Overall, it's okay? It's worthy of the price. It's very thin and its good looks are the reasons why I bought it. To sum up, end"
It's quite big and substantial. The screen display and sound quality are very good. It would be perfect if the battery life could be longer. It is worthy of being a powerful tool for audio-visual entertainment.
The logistics was too slow. I had to wait five days for it to arrive. The customer service attitude was not good. They didn’t even send a film. The system response seemed a bit slow.
"The battery of this mobile phone is not very durable. It can be on standby for up to 7 hours at work, and it shuts down before I get off work. This makes me carry a power bank with me every day, which is very frustrating."
"That’s a lie. It’s just a tablet and a charger, nothing else. What a 75 gift package."
The price is reduced* after buying it. I really want to return it and not buy it.
Shopping on JD.com is great and fast. The 8-inch tablet phone (Huawei m2) has clear calls and good video quality. The service attitude of JD.com is very good and I give it full marks. I will buy and sell on JD.com next time and support JD.com!
"I bought it as a birthday gift for my mother. The screen is big, the performance can meet the requirements, and the price is reasonable. My mother likes it very much."
The card slot was shaking and there was no response after trying 3 cards. The courier guy was so nice and the delivery was fast.
"I bought this tablet during a sale and it was 300 yuan cheaper. It is cheap, good quality and very cost-effective."
very good! Runs very fast and smoothly
"This is my first time buying a tablet, and it feels pretty good. It supports domestic production!"
"Banana milk is very popular now, right? I accidentally discovered that Mengniu also sells it. I don’t know what it tastes like. 11 Dayang"
"It always clicks, and sometimes there is no response, so be careful when buying it! ! ! Can't figure out what's going on."
Not very useful
"The Chinese people should strongly support Midea, a national brand. I like this water heater very much. The capacity of 40 liters is just right! ! ! , looking forward to working together again! ! !"
"Haha, I received it. I couldn’t wait to open it as soon as I received it. The packaging is very beautiful! ! Haha, I found out that I made a profit as soon as I opened it. I turned on the computer and downloaded a few games to play. There was no lag at all. Haha. Must 5"
Nor are they called Mengniu or Yili.
"It shut down automatically as soon as I opened it, and it has scratches! Second-hand items were sold to me, but they refused to return them due to quality issues on the pretext that I had made them flowery. Huawei Jingmou will go bankrupt sooner or later! I want to complain to the end!"
"Not so good! Easy to get hot! Only 1.Multiple gigabytes of runnable memory. The resolution is low. The camera is poor, just like the camera of the previous button machine. Sound quality is okay"
"Mengniu is still pretty good, affordable and the cheapest. . . ."
"Let’s not talk about the machine. Our JD Express here is too slow. It took two days to deliver at a snail’s pace. If we don’t call, we still don’t know when it will be delivered."
It’s so bad that it will automatically go to sleep when watching a movie with the condom on.
"Reply If you don’t drink Nestle, you have nothing to drink. If you don’t drink Mengniu, you drink Nestle."
"It's rubbish. The resolution is very poor and the pixels are also poor. In addition, the promised next-day delivery is a day late. What does it mean to use a big Xiaomi box to install a Huawei tablet?"
"It’s really good. I have always trusted JD.com. So far, I only have JD.com as an online shopping platform, so I feel very happy every time I shop. Thank you JD.com."
"I don’t know what’s going on, but the phone shuts down when it’s out of battery, and then it won’t turn on when I’m charging it."
"The phone is very good, but the customer service is rubbish, especially Yuandou, Broad Bean, and Peach. The three rubbish disposal issues have not been solved. I don’t want to give it a star. Just because of these three rubbish, I will never buy any Huawei mobile phone in the future. Got it"
"Express delivery is as slow as crawling, which is really different from usual JD.com"
Quit replying early. Mengniu has had many problematic incidents! Reply Mengniu is really going to kill people. Stay away from it as soon as possible. You have given up on Mengniu a long time ago! resist!
"Oh no, no, the machine is jammed to death."
The # Mengniu Free Travel# event has begun. Everyone needs to eat and drink well to have the strength to visit the Mengniu headquarters.
"It couldn't be worse. It jumps every now and then. If there are zero stars, I will give them zero stars."
So far so good!
It’s quite affordable to use.
"For the second one, my colleague bought a WiFi version, and I bought the LTE version, which is pretty good in all aspects."
"The tablet is very good, the proportions are very suitable, and it is comfortable to watch movies. The resolution is very high, and it’s the most cost-effective among tablets! Those who didn't get the 64G can only buy a 32G one. Definitely praise!"
"I just received it today. It's very good. It feels good in the hand and is quite thin. The screen is big enough! ! After using it for a while, the system is smooth. Jingdong is great?(???`)"
Overall not bad! Swiping the screen to boot is not particularly sensitive. It’s not a problem either! Been using it and it’s great!
Mengniu is shameless! Don’t drink domestic milk! shameless
"Broken mobile phone, fully charged mobile phone, rubbish. It’s so rubbish. I can’t even use it for half a day. It loses a lot of power in standby mode. I charge it several times a day. I never comment. It’s the first time because it’s really rubbish."
The size is too stingy
"Things are pretty good, faster than phones with the same hardware configuration"
"Very good, trust Huawei!"
The product is genuine. I called the national service hotline and installed it quickly.
"Cheap and easy to use, like it! Support domestic production"
The pixels are so bad
"Yes, it supports JD.com and Huawei. It’s worth buying! I will always use Huawei!"
I got the baby. Thank you. I placed the order yesterday afternoon and it arrived today. It’s the style I like. Thank you. I tested the internet speed as soon as I got it. The internet speed is super fast.
"All five stars. I bought 9 of them in one go. Customers said they would use them well...50 liters and 40 liters, for hotel use."
Classic Mengniu 9 billion resource integration case! Wonderful presentation of strategic retreat
"After all, the price is here. The sound effect is good and the running speed is fast. I bought it for someone else. After trying it for a few days, there are no quality problems."
"Speechless, no stickers,"
"The item itself is not bad, but the price has been reduced as soon as it was purchased and cannot be guaranteed, which is very annoying."
"Bought for mom! It took me so long to evaluate it, it’s really good! Really good. . ."
Feasible to combine with reality
I will never choose JD.com again from now on. The price was reduced as soon as I bought it. It’s so shameless. The machine is stuck. Whoever buys it will regret it. The customer service is rubbish.
"I bought it at midnight on 6.18 and gave it to my mother so that she can search online and watch Chinese painting teaching videos. The speed is very fast and the picture is clear, but the screen width is too narrow and I haven’t gotten used to it yet."
"Dad likes it very much, mainly because of the big screen"
"It looks average in appearance, but I’m annoyed by the constant advertising plug-ins as I play."
"When I first started using it, I thought the machine was fine, but I didn’t know how it would fare over time."
"Mengniu real fruit grains, Uncle Qi’s favorite. Suck out the fruit pellets."
I bought it for the elderly. It’s not bad.
"In general, the stuff provided is garbage. If it can’t be used, don’t get it."
"If you buy it on the first day, the price will be reduced the next day and you will get free gifts! I asked customer service in advance if there were any events and they didn’t tell me! I was really drunk too!"
"I’m so depressed. I don’t have the earphones, the film, or the case. I hope there won’t be any problems with the phone."
"I bought it just to play a game, but what’s worth mentioning is the sound effect, which is really good. Dual speakers, wow."
"Honest Mengniu, ""kindly"" Uncle Businessman... This country is in chaos"
"The phone is good, but it doesn’t have headphones or a protective film. I hope to at least add headphones."
"It’s really rubbish. The screen is not very sensitive. I originally bought it after using a Huawei phone and thought the quality was very good. However, the quality of this tablet is too poor. I’ll give it a bad review."
"After using it for four or five days, my mother said that the battery was not durable. It ran out of power after a day of not being used much. It was far inferior to the previous Honor X4."
"No invoice, no reply when asked, bad review, bad review"
"Logistics is very fast, it works well!"
"It’s still a good Huawei tablet, much better than Xiaomi, but I don’t know why the screen resolution doesn’t seem to be that high."
not bad. Just give me something as a gift.
Mengniu is really dedicated and even worked overtime on February 30th!
I bought the second one. Not to mention the price increase. The sound is very small and the signal when connecting to the wireless network is poor. The first one is very useful.
"Good board, buy more"
"Bought this for my mom, it works well~"
Bought this for my husband. He is not very satisfied. The packaging is simple and the headphones are not ideal. I’ll just use it!
The speed is very fast and there is no lag at all. The next application will be ready in just a few seconds. It’s not bad.
"I asked the customer service staff before I got in line if there were any gifts. After repeated confirmation, it turned out that there were no gifts. I deceived consumers and misled consumers. This was really the first time I encountered integrity."
"Boycott foodies! As expected, Mengniu yogurt was served later. The lady in the back seat drank heartily."
I have bought this tablet before and thought it was pretty good. This time I took advantage of the 618 big sale and bought another one. The delivery was as fast as ever~ It must be a full five points~
This is a counterfeit product. The Huawei I used before has always worked well. The Huawei I bought this time made me speechless. It often crashes and often disconnects under normal network connection. I am really speechless.
"What about Tencent Video membership card? If you can’t afford it, don’t write it on it to deceive consumers."
"There is no lag in playing Honor of Kings, it’s ok, great."
"Not long after I bought it, the price of this ** dropped."
"Overall, I feel very good, but my charger is broken. Less than a month later, I feel unhappy. I hope it can be solved! ! !"
"The buttons don’t work, the screen often won’t click, and I can’t even send a message. I’ve only bought it two months ago."
"It’s so hot today. It’s best to have some ice cream. It turns out that Mengniu pudding has been upgraded. It’s bigger, thicker and more delicious. Haha, it’s not the same Mengniu pudding that you could finish in two bites before.) I’m staying in the dormitory in the afternoon."
"It's very good and worth buying. The sound quality of Harman Kardon is very good. It has high definition for watching movies and TV, and you can watch 2k movies."
I have used it for so many days before I can evaluate it. The overall performance is still good so far. It can expand the memory card. Let’s see how it goes in the future!
The one I bought and kept is the third one.
"The speed is pretty good, thumbs up"
"The low score given is just because of the film. It would be better not to give it a film. When I looked at the dust on the screen and was helpless, alas"
"Domestic machines have caught up with Apple in terms of performance in recent years. It’s just that the proprietary software is missing a bit. However, this is not used figuratively. I just applied a handful of pesticides when I brought it. The large screen makes it difficult to operate conveniently."
It's too watery and will break when touched. It's not good.
I bought it and have been using it for so long. It’s not that good.
"It feels like a parallel import. I have been using it for less than a month. The response is too slow. Occasionally, there is no sound when making phone calls."
"I bought it by taking advantage of 618, the quality is as good as ever"
"#healthydinnershare# I am using the iPhone app ""Eat and Lose"" to record that I ate Mengniu Guanyi Milk for dinner today, 107 grams, 54 calories @Health 4 Plus 1"
"Rubbish, pure rubbish, the memory card keeps failing to mount, Youku videos keep failing to open, stuck, that’s it."
I finally witnessed the price drop after buying it.
"I have always wanted to buy a small tablet for my mother that can play mobile phones. Huawei Honor was my first choice. After comparing it, I bought this one. I bought the last one and my mother is very happy with it!"
"I can't feel the presence of the card on my phone, so I don't want to give it a single star."
"I only bought a high-end configuration. I don’t know the difference between high-end configuration and low-end configuration. Then, when I watched a video or something and the battery was strong, it was okay."
I will always support Mengniu. I will drink the products from my hometown wherever I go. Hehe.
The phone is okay. It has 13 million pixels. I want to say it has 3 million pixels. It’s not as good as the 8 million pixels I’ve been using for two years.
"jJingdong logistics is very fast, delivery is the next day, and the tablet speed is very smooth! The price is right too! Support domestic products!"
"The machine sometimes freezes and is very difficult to use! Pixels, resolution, and running memory are all very low."
"The screen resolution is too low! It lags as soon as I get it, I regret it! The resolution is too poor..."
"The harm of drugs is far greater than cutting cakes. Mengniu will last forever, and cutting cakes will remain forever. . . . ."
"I want to ask why there are no ear wires! Mobile phones costing several hundred yuan are equipped with ear wires! Why don't you, over a thousand people, have no ear wires? You even said there were freebies, but you didn't even see them! ! Bad review"
"After using it for half a month, there is a big red spot on the screen without any bump or touch. The quality is too low, and there is a big bulge near the volume button on the outer metal frame."
"I finally know why Mengniu’s yogurt in our school is so cheap, because Mengniu’s yogurt factory is right next to our school. I’m at #Baotou Medical College# http:t.cn/zOgJuEk"
It's okay for taking pictures.
Fuck Mengniu is an idiot
"It's pretty good to use, the metal plate on the back is very textured, the screen is clear, and the response is okay."
"Bought for the elderly to watch video and TV series, the configuration is sufficient, the price is not expensive, the appearance is beautiful, but it is a bit heavy, there is no protective cover, JD Express is top-notch! ! !"
"The tablet is very useful for watching videos and playing games in your hand. The screen is clear and the battery is durable, which is pretty good."
"Not satisfied! I originally chose a gold one, but they sent me a silver one! ! !"
"Because the mobile phone is also from Huawei, I also chose Huawei for the tablet. I thought that I would not be able to receive the goods on time, but the courier brother delivered it at 8:30 in the evening. I was so touched and thank you for the hard work of the courier brother."
A very good machine. I have purchased it many times. I always trust and support JD.com!
"The price will be reduced after buying it, bad review! The battery is not enough. The power went out instantly."
"Jingdong is speechless. It is a fighter among garbage. After buying something, it refused to deliver it for ten days. It forced the order to be cancelled, but it also refused to refund the money."
"After using it for half a day, the machine got stuck twice and I had to restart it. It was very annoying."
Sister Mei’s Mengniu ancient yogurt is so delicious that it makes her angry. Ha~
The goods I ordered yesterday were delivered today. It was fast and the service attitude was very good.
"When I took the photo, it showed 1399, but 1499 was deducted from the payment. It was useless to contact customer service. No one could solve it. The actual payment shall prevail."
Rubbish. The card explodes
"The touch screen is sensitive, the screen is clear, the stuff is good, and it is suitable for event purchases."
"The resolution is too low, I regret buying it."
The game is too big and has a bit of a lag. Everything else is great. It’s really fun to watch TV.
"Okay, that's mine."
I will never buy Mengniu in the future.
The response is a bit slow and the resolution is a bit low
"I really want to cry. I really despise this tablet. I might as well spend this money to buy a Nokia senior phone. At least it won’t freeze, and I won’t refund or repair it."
"What a piece of shit! Less than a month after I bought it, it kept crashing! At first I thought there were too many things installed, so I deleted them all! Still crashed!"
"If you borrow Mengniu's bag and carry it for two days, you won't be criticized by the teacher = ="
"After using it for a while, I found that it is really good, especially after it is equipped with a membrane and a leather case. It feels very comfortable to use, which is really good."
"I'm lazy, I have too many backlogs and I haven't evaluated them yet. I'll give them a unified evaluation. Dongdong is not bad!"
"There are no gifts at all, just a tablet. Jingdong is so stupid. It’s not like this anywhere I buy it."
"On the first day back home, the screen broke! Don't know if the warranty is"
"I bought it for my parents. When I came back from a business trip, I noticed that the sound was very low."
The stuff is very good. It was delivered quickly by express delivery. I’m trying it out now.
The packaging is complete and no damage. The screen display is high-precision and operability is strong. I bought it during a promotion and the price-performance ratio is very high.
"Jingdong’s after-sales service is so bad. If there is a problem, I reported it for repair, but they didn’t reply for many days! There are so many options to call and I can’t find anyone! I will never buy anything from JD.com again! !"
"This tablet is okay. You can watch TV and play games. I can play a mobile game for half an hour and then log out and log in without getting stuck. If I keep playing, it will get stuck or freeze. Overall, it's pretty good. It costs a few hundred yuan, so it's pretty good. I'll give it an eighty-point rating."
You can also use brand sponsorship to boost domestic demand. Dairyman’s tights say Mengniu Sponsored or something like that.
Mengniu... is very good at controlling prices.
The screen is big enough and easy to use
What a beautiful package @ Mengniu
"The resolution is very low, and the advantage is that the price is cheap, but the price was reduced right after I bought it, and the coupon difference cannot protect the price, so I was disappointed even if I bought it at a discounted price."
"It's rubbish. Two days after I bought it, the screen doesn't work when I touch it. It won't move and it jumps around when I don't press it."
"The price drops* after buying for a few days. It was also said that it was not eligible to apply for price protection. All kinds of rhetoric. Forget it, accept your bad luck. Wang Sicong said it well, the store bullies customers."
Sponsored by Mengniu?
This is the second time I bought this phone. The first one was dropped and the screen broke. It works great.
"Looking at the picture, I couldn’t wait to take a look after I got it. When I got home, I took it apart and tried to operate it. It was really good, genuine, and JD.com’s self-operated logistics is fast."
"I originally thought that Xiaomi's tablets were already unsatisfactory, but I didn't expect that Huawei's tablets were even worse. The resolution, workmanship, sound, and system were all terrible."
I bought another one and can’t stop it at all. The screen is big and fast. It’s a must-have for watching movies and playing games.
"It’s only been two days since I bought it, and I restarted midway through playing Honor of Kings."
I bought my second one and am still very satisfied with my purchase.
Pixels are too bad
"It’s been more than a week since I bought it before I reviewed it. Everyone recommended me to buy an iPod, but I think it’s still good."
"Scammer, the price dropped by dozens and I only bought it a few days ago!"
"The speed of delivery is nothing to say, the tablet looks very clear, not bad! Not used yet, will review after using it"
"The express delivery is very fast, but the mobile phone disappoints me. It doesn’t even have headphones. I really feel that this mobile phone is not worth 900. Although it is for the elderly at home, it is too cheap. Bad review! ! !"
"I bought it during an event, just for the elderly to use WeChat. I don’t have high functional requirements. I tried it a few times and it was okay."
"Damn it, there are a lot of apps that don’t exist and I can’t even delete them. It runs on 3G, and a bunch of raki software almost takes up 2G. Alas, I really don’t like it."
"Not satisfied, I only got a charger when I bought it, and nothing else. I had to buy it myself, which is a bit deceptive! Consumers, keep your eyes open!"
"Cheap but not good, not very satisfied"
It’s a very good tablet. Everyone says it looks good and is fast. JD’s service is also good. I like it.
"The items are okay, but the delivery speed is really annoying. I called customer service seven or eight times, but they were always perfunctory. I was promised that it would be delivered the next day, but it took three days to arrive. I won’t buy anything on JD.com again next time."
A very conscientious tablet that supports domestic products.
"Jingdong’s products are very good and easy to use, and they keep coming back. Is that enough?"
"Generally speaking, after using it for less than half a month, the screen starts to freeze and the running speed is very slow. I really regret it. It is best not to buy it. The pixels are very poor. Thank you."
"The system is smooth, the sound quality is good, and it is very comfortable to listen to music and watch movies. The screen display is also very good. Battery life is also decent. All in all, I am quite satisfied with this tablet."
"Generally speaking, the workmanship is rough. You should buy a new version. This January 2015 version, why is Huawei still selling it? It’s too much."
"Very good quality tablet, supports Huawei"
"The mobile phone screen is big and clear, the battery has long standby time and the logistics is fast."
So rubbish
"After using it for a while, I feel it is okay, but the fingerprint recognition is not very sensitive and I have to press it several times each time."
"I used it for a period of time and then reviewed it, and the response was okay. It’s just that the phone is really slow to browse the web. It’s faster than the Rubik’s Cube tablet I’ve used before! Huawei doesn’t dare to compliment you."
"Not bad, it’s enough to watch movies and listen to music."
The speed is okay. It’s okay at this price. You should have no problem playing LOL.
A birthday gift for my mother. I like it very much. The workmanship is exquisite. The system is smooth and the screen is clear. Huawei’s technology is getting better and better. 32g is enough.
"The screen resolution is a bit low,"
The mobile phone is good. I have bought several of them and recommend them to my colleagues! Very good value for money! Will continue to support domestic Huawei in the future
"It's too bad, it means it's a wealth list, giving away the most valuable Oriental wealth software; but after getting it, I found out that the so-called Oriental wealth software is free."
"Mengniu's statement is that they invited my friend to have a meal. I wonder if he is an insider? Are consumers so easy to fool, or do they think girls are so easy to pick up? Reject Mengniu, cherish life..."
"Very beautiful, for the elderly at home, very good"
"Well, it's okay...."
"I have been fancying this tablet for a long time, because I need a tablet like this for work. Huawei came out with it. It has good workmanship, 2k screen resolution, and just the right size. It’s just that the price is strong. I was holding back and bought it during Children's Day."
"Jingdong Express is very fast. If you buy it on the same day, it will arrive the next morning. It’s very high-definition to watch movies. It’s worth buying."
This 2G network is too slow for the elderly. .
"Pros Appearance, price"
"Yes, if you don’t buy Mengniu, then you won’t buy Mengniu either."
"If you buy Huawei tablets at the same price through the same purchase method, some come with a film holder and memory card, while others don’t come with anything, which feels a bit confusing!"
Just arrived. Pick it up by yourself. Arranged for delivery but no one delivered it. The promised time has passed. No invoice was seen in the goods.
"Huawei’s phones are really rubbish, the previous Honor 6P"
"The size feels just right. When I first got it, the room card didn't show up when I entered it, so I thought there was something wrong. Then I discovered that the problem was that I put the card in without turning off the phone, so it didn't show up. Customer service is also very good"
"It feels good to have the machine, and the delivery speed is also very good, very fast."
The size is just right and the HD screen is easy to use. The sound quality is also good.
"Mengniu drank until I felt like vomiting, and it continued to develop into a brain-dead level. Dealing with the garbage at home has always been my specialty."
"Bought this for my son, have fun..."
"I opened the package and found scratches. After using it for another day, I found that the system was stuck and some software was installed and unusable. They would not give me a return or exchange. I seriously suspect it’s a refurbished machine!!"
It's very rubbish. The screen always freezes when watching TV. I don't regret taking the medicine.
I bought it at a special price at that time. Today I saw it was still 50 yuan more expensive. I felt like I was cheated.
Nutritious and healthy breakfast... Mengniu’s new packaging... I wonder if it’s a new flavor... The morning fog in the warm sunshine has finally dispersed... I’m in an exceptionally good mood... I’m going on a long trip in the afternoon... The sky is really awesome...
"I received the item today. It looks good. I hope it can be used. However, I was a little disappointed because it didn’t come with anything."
"No, there is a screen malfunction. If you are playing Honor of Kings, please pay attention. Sometimes when you press Move, you can’t release skills and level A, and multi-touch becomes single-touch."
I haven’t drank Mengniu for many years.
Mengniu cannot be drunk. Scared me to death. I will never change my impression of Mengniu in my life. It's so shameless to point out! ! !
I feel very bad. I support domestic products.
"I had it when I was a few years old, but I have forgotten the name and the taste. I didn’t think it was particularly delicious when I was a kid. What impressed me most was that Mengniu or Yili popsicles had chocolate flavor~"
The most failed online purchase. The negative reviews didn’t say anything about it. It’s so rubbish.
The tablet is suitable for mounting and can also be used as a stand
"It's okay to use this, no problem for now, I will continue to evaluate it later."
No case screen film
"Reply Mengniu customer service’s timely feedback is worthy of recognition. I hope that, as you said, Mengniu will become the safest dairy product in China."
The stuff is really good.
The resolution is too low and sometimes it freezes
"It's such a crappy tablet, it crashes when playing any game. And it's stuck terribly. It's not worth the price. It hurts my heart to lose."
The company used to buy it for business. The price is affordable and it has a large screen. Now customers are asking for help to buy it. It is affordable.
"The sound is too low when making phone calls. I bought this for my dad. I am not particularly satisfied with it, so I make do with it. Others are quite good. I bought it at 789."
very nice. . . . . . . . . .
I just bought it a week ago and I don’t even have headphones. Isn’t it deceiving people to send a lot of them now?
Why don’t I get a protective case and earphones with my second purchase?
I have been purchasing products on JD.com. I personally feel that the quality is guaranteed and the delivery speed is fast.
"Very beautiful, just like the description. Let’s see how it goes after using it."
"Not bad, worth having"
The * yuan I bought on March 1st became * yuan for you in half a month. This is why I gave you a bad review.
"Beautiful, little one likes it."
"The price was reduced right after I bought it, and JD.com still won’t refund the difference. Bad review?"
"I just bought it and the price went down again. It’s so annoying, and sometimes the signal reception is not particularly good."
"The battery of this phone is also so bad that it runs out of power after just half a day of making normal calls! I thought it was an individual case, so I called customer service and asked me to test it myself. This was a bit unjustifiable!"
"It’s not easy to use, the rhythm is a bit laggy, and it’s a bit confusing to watch TV."
So heartbroken! Negative star!
"It’s not easy to use, not as easy as Xiaomi! The key is not to cover the screen. There is only one switch key to lock and brighten the screen, it’s so damn OUT!"
Slow response and freeze.
There are actually black edges! Bad review! There is a word on the side of the novel that I didn’t see! What a trap! More than a thousand yuan was wasted like this!
"The elderly version of the tablet can open a webpage and watch a video faster than a mobile phone, and the photos taken can be anything but clear."
It's okay to use. Let's see what happens next
"I just bought it and am trying it out, but I didn’t see the jacket that came with it."
"What the hell is this tablet? It's fine for normal use, but I bought a protective case for fear of getting it damaged. After I put it on, the touch screen didn't respond when I clicked on it. When I took it out, it was fine again. What if I don’t put it in the case and the screen gets crushed?"
"I feel like I was cheated, so I bought it for my mother and will take a look when I get home! Purely fake product! Not worth the price!"
"I haven’t bought # Mengniu # #??# for many years, and I won’t buy it in the future either."
"I haven’t used it yet, but overall it looks pretty good. I’ll review it after I use it."
"Nice stuff, amazing! It fits just right in hand. However, there is a defective pixel, which has not been processed through JD.com, but is being processed through Huawei's physical repair center."
The screen resolution is not clear! Everything else is fine! Standby is a waste! You can also play the King! !
The video is very clear and the running speed is OK
"Unscrupulous merchant, the packaging is simple and fake. It's stuck to use. It was more than a hundred dollars more expensive than others. I found out and said I would refund the price difference but didn't. I hope you won’t be fooled"
The touch screen responds slowly and the phone feels okay
OK OK:! !
"Within a month, the computer crashed frequently and could not be turned on."
"Additional review, not bad. Bought for my family, good reviews. Support Huawei."
"Not bad. The resolution is a bit low, but it's adequate. This one has no call function and can only connect to wireless network."
"It’s so rubbish, I won’t buy it again next time"
"It’s good to watch the video. The quality is pretty good, but the price changes every day. I'm speechless about the price. It's the same price every day."
"Anyway, I have to take it back for repairs within a week after I bought it, and I don’t know what the problem is."
"It has not been installed yet. The seller is very responsible and has a good service attitude. Originally, the express delivery said that it would not be delivered upstairs. The seller's customer service helped communicate and then the express delivery was delivered to the door. Thank you to the seller. Five points in total. ."
"Received the item quickly, beautifully packaged, JD.com 618 is really cheap!"
"Jingdong is fast, great, as good as ever, awesome!"
It’s been a long time since I drank Mengniu and Yili. It’s so disgusting.
"good! The size is just right, so children can use it as a tablet to play with and make phone calls to adults! It’s very convenient to put it at home"
The clarity and resolution are extremely low. The words are all squiggled and the proportions are inconsistent. It’s just a brick. It’s not worth recommending. I mailed it back to my hometown and it’s inconvenient to exchange it.
"I paid special attention to the flight attendant's service, which was quite good. The dinner was really shabby, just a sandwich and not even the Mengniu yogurt that Air China likes to give out."
"I really can’t drink anything from Mengniu. . So disgusting. . It's so disgusting, Mengniu is disgusting, bugs are even more disgusting, and masturbating to bugs is the most disgusting thing! I wipe. . I've been drinking this for the past two days. . . . Never buy again! ! !"
Take two Mengniu Youyi C drinks a week to keep your body healthy.
"The merchant is really funny. Although there is a place for earphones in the charger box, he insists on taking the earphones out and asking the first 50 people to give earphones as a gift. It’s really interesting! I won't give you a good review based on this."
"I don’t want to buy a Huawei phone in this life, it’s so bad. After using it for less than 10 days, the body became bent inexplicably. This is the first time I have encountered a mobile phone with such poor quality. I suggest you never buy it. If you buy it, you will regret it."
"The phone is still good, but the screen broke when it was dropped in water a month after I bought it. It costs 900 to get a replacement screen from Huawei after-sales service. ."
This is the last cooperation with JD.com. Everything is old.
It’s very good. I bought one for others too.
"An economical and practical mobile phone,"
"There is smearing, but it is not serious and does not affect the use. It's bigger than expected, 8.4 inches after all. The response speed is great, 950 is not a problem."
I didn’t bring headphones. Why are you so stupid? Everything else is fine.
"Every time I enter the game, I feel the response is very slow."
"There is a small spot on the screen that is not very obvious and cannot be wiped off. I don’t know why. It doesn’t affect the display, so I don’t care about it."
I just received the item and haven’t installed it yet. It looks like a good replacement.
"Fast logistics, thin and light, fast, suitable for the elderly and children to watch videos and play games, the price is good!"
Very good. I like it very much. It’s worth the money. I bought it for the third time.
"Slow, hard to use, low resolution"
"I bought it for my family, so it should be fine. Anyway, it has been offline. The atmosphere is that personal information has been leaked. Does anyone know when, where, and what model and product I bought? I called him. It's very unhelpful. !"
I support it. The domestic quality is very good. I also believe that JD.com’s delivery is very fast. It arrived the next day.
"Yili milk is not as delicious as Mengniu's...but the red date kefir is okay...Mengniu's Tetra Pak pure milk is good, and the best one is walnut milk...Sanyuan's is also pretty good, just look at this review. I suspect I have milk poisoning..."
"I have received the goods, but the problem is that there is no charger or earphones. I would like to ask the store, what should I do if I charge them? You just give me a bare phone?"
I received the phone and used it for a few hours. It has a standby time of 6 hours. It’s very powerful.
I saw expired Mengniu and Yili products in my hometown in the countryside. They are a bunch of heartless stuff and a rip-off! ! ! ! ! !
"Logistics is very fast, very satisfied! Economical and affordable, fast and no lag! I might recommend it to a friend to buy."
Mengniu breakfast milk~new packaging~'
"With 1G of running memory, the result is only about 450! When I play the next game, it says there is insufficient memory! Bad review!"
I like to drink Mengniu. I also like Bainiu. Favorite white cow
"The phone is very slow, it stutters a lot when playing single-player games, and the touch screen is not very responsive. I'll just use it, I'm too lazy to return it."
"Damn it, why is it 50 yuan more?"
"Very useful,,,,,, like it like it"
"The phone is a good one, but it feels a bit big for a phone and a bit small for a tablet. I’m not used to it."
"Can't make phone calls. The sound quality is great! Not to mention the sound effects! The system is very smooth, the experience is great, and the price/performance ratio is very good!"
"The battery life is about the same as that of a mobile phone. I can watch movies for three hours. The screen is average, the touch sensitivity is poor, the display is a bit gray and not clear enough"
The screen feels so bad. Huawei is getting worse and worse. The resolution of the highest configuration version I bought is so bad that I have lost confidence in Huawei. You get what you pay for and I am too lazy to return it……………… ……………
The clarity is not high and the color reproduction is very poor. I don’t know what the good reviews are.
"It’s a crappy phone, it can’t be charged right after I received it! ! ! It really affects my mood! !"
"There is only a charger and a tablet, not even headphones, protective film, memory card and nothing else."
"Good value for money, great effects, smooth movie watching."
I just bought the Mengniu original yogurt at Xizhimen Huatang Supermarket. I found it was leaking when I came back. I threw away two bottles before I started drinking. The quality problem is too serious @ Mengniu Dairy
The price is a bit expensive
"I've been too busy recently, so I checked it late. I bought it for my colleagues. The stuff is very good, haha."
My Mengniu Sour Yogurt @ Tangled Big Nose Bubbles
Haven't opened it yet
It should be pretty good. The house is rented out and I have no use for it. The installer was very nice and brought his own materials.
"I'm a little disappointed. It said it comes with 16G of built-in memory, but it only has more than 10. The speaker sound quality is very poor and sounds a bit hoarse. Just make do with it. Logistics is very fast."
The water heater is very good. The packaging is also very nice. Worth buying.
"Not bad, the pixels are low and the screen looks dazzling when sliding"
The quality is good. I bought it for a customer and have been using it for a while.
The Honor Tablet has a large screen of nearly 10 square meters and is very comfortable to use. It also feels fast to use. I am very satisfied.
"Bad review, bad review, bad review, I don’t want to give even half a point."
"It's not very stable. The wireless network is disconnected after the phone screen goes black, which is very inconvenient."
"Easy to use, very satisfied with my purchase, I buy it often"
"It doesn’t support USB flash drives, and it’s not clearly written in the product introduction. It’s too deceptive. Bad review."
I tried it as soon as I received it and it was fine. I have been using Huawei phones and I feel like I can buy another tablet.
"How can I put it this way, I didn’t get anything when I bought it, but the price was reduced on the third day. I felt really bad. I thought it would also give me a tablet protective case, but it turned out I didn’t get anything. I feel really bad!"
"I just had my phone tuned less than half a month after I bought it. I’m so sad, so sad. I’m too lazy to comment. Wow woo woo."
Mengniu's positive energy is just for a little bit of happiness.
The goods have been installed and have not been used yet. The actual product is consistent with the seller's description. The appearance of the water heater is also very beautiful. It is more than a hundred cheaper than the physical store. SF Express is very efficient.
"It’s not that great. Not long after I bought it, it often freezes and then automatically restarts after a while."
"Gave it to my father-in-law to watch TV, he was satisfied!"
The product has been received. It’s a beautiful machine. I like it very much. The color is also very beautiful. The logistics is very fast. The courier guy has a very good attitude. ?
It looks like someone else has used it. The alarm clock I ordered is still there. I'm drunk too.
"Rubbish. Don't buy it, everyone. There was a problem within two weeks. Grass"
"The configuration is relatively high, and it’s fun to watch videos and play games. The only thing I’m not satisfied with is that the price dropped right after I bought it."
"Yes, the price is right, cost-effective, a good choice, I bought two of them, the response is fast, and it supports domestic products"
Not bad. Bought at 1789
I boycott Mengniu!
"Why isn't it true? ! Is the packaging P? Aren’t Mengniu’s top executives worried that Chinese people won’t buy it? Despite the negative news, he is still queuing up to buy Ha! So hard! It’s so hard at Mengniu. I’ll be at work on the 30th."
"I chose it for a friend, she liked it better and replied that it works well."
"The stuff is good, really good, the resolution is quite high, better than expected, the system is smooth and not stuck."
"We are all future elites, Mengniu future stars! Hahahahahaha"
Could it be from Mengniu? Mengniu has been having problems lately! I'm afraid of drinking
"Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish!"
"The outsourcing was in good condition and the delivery was fast, but I was not given an invoice -."
"For JD.com, I will buy things, but I will never give a positive review in my life because you guys suck."
It’s rubbish. No wonder it keeps following Mengniu. The quality of its products is so bad. I will firmly refuse to buy Yi products in the future.
"It looks exquisite, I like it very much. It feels better in hand than in the picture."
The screen is huge and the service is great. A very satisfying purchase.
"After using it for almost a month, three corners have cracked and it has never been dropped. The quality is too bad, right?"
"# Success College Food Culture Festival# Mengniu is really awesome, so awesome, haha"
"The phone is so-so, but the price reduction is too fast. It dropped by 200 in just a few days. Regret buying it."
"Shameless, continue to boycott Mengniu Yili"
"Mengniu announced an unconditional recall of 3,000 boxes of ""milk with tampered production dates"" 8 In response to the case of ""a Mengniu manager was caught tampering with the production dates"", yesterday #VIVA Changdu# http:t.cn/zWnvqo4"
"The resolution is really low. I strongly recommend not buying it. Even watching videos on WiFi is stuck. It’s not as good as a mobile phone. The response is not sensitive yet, and it gets stuck after a week of use."
"The battery is not working well, it needs to be recharged twice a day, which is too wasteful."
"The call volume is so low that even when it is turned to the highest level, I can’t hear clearly. It’s unusable for the elderly."
"Mengniu WeChat customer service has been communicating through messages in the past few days, sincerely saying that they are sorry to consumers and saying that they need to reflect on and improve management. I am very touched by this."
It’s really bad. I regret buying it. Can I return it?
"Good stuff, good value for money, durable battery, fast response"
Not bad? Not bad?.
"The camera cannot focus and there are black lines on the screen; the customer service said that there is no problem with the product quality and that return shipping will be charged. However, after the return for quality inspection, the quality inspection personnel said that it was indeed a product problem and no shipping charges were required."
"I bought it to fight the King's Guard, but the result was that the card was flying, and I almost wanted to drop the tablet. One star was too much."
"The tablet is very good, the screen is comfortable, and the colleague who bought it for a colleague likes it very much"
"It's a gift for relatives and friends, I don't know, what exactly is it like?"
"Very good, good quality and cheap, just for reading, it's enough"
The resolution is too low. It is recommended to watch something else later. It will be too harmful to the eyes.

"No need to explain, it just arrived yesterday, and today I will give you a one-year membership card without replacement."
"After using it for two days, I noticed there was a flaw near the fingerprint button. I don’t know what it was. It couldn’t be wiped off, but I had to hold it against the light to see it."
The logistics will arrive the next day?
"Internet speed is fast, good, good, good"
"I only buy things here. It’s safe, fast, assured, and supported. I will stick to the glory of humanity until the end."
Rubbish! I've been using it for half a month and now I can't turn it on! can you tell me why
"My parents use it, they like it very much"
This tablet is really not that good. It’s very laggy. Don’t be fooled. The screen still has bright spots. It’s been a disaster for JD.com.
"I'm so dizzy. I bought it for 799 yesterday, and the price was reduced to 699 today, which is a 100 drop. Isn't this a scam? Extremely bad review. Bad review."
"No problem for now, I’ll check it later"
A scam. It didn’t take long for the screen to look like this.
"I was confused! Should I switch to Mengniu’s bankruptcy or switch to dark chocolate? Go to Mengniu’s bankruptcy! ! As for Mengniu, go bankrupt!"
This is the third time I have visited. I have bought 6 units. I received them yesterday and haven’t installed them yet. They should be right. Please leave a positive review first.

"The display color is too fake. I have always relied on Huawei, but now I am really disappointed after buying this phone!"
"Another day has passed, and my mother’s food is really delicious. I would be surprised if I don’t gain weight if this continues! Have a cup of yogurt at night to digest it! Mengniu’s oatmeal yellow peach yogurt is delicious!"
"The appearance is good, but the black edges are quite serious. I will evaluate it after I have just started using it!"
"The video is relatively smooth, the response speed is fast, and the overall appearance is fashionable, but the black edges are a bit eye-catching."
It’s good. A country this big should have its own brand and quality. I believe you will get better and better!
"#12315# Many years later, the ""second-material"" toy, Mengniu Milk, is still there and can't be separated from it. . Details: http:t.cn/zYYS25Y"
"The screen is large, making it easy to watch dramas."
"The video is not clear, the resolution is not high, the phone function is not working"
"Very good, very powerful"
It’s so confusing! ! I bought it yesterday and got a discount of ?* today! Jingdong garbage!
The CEO of Mengniu is very handsome~ to put it mildly~
"The tablet is good, cheap and good quality, I like it very much."
I bought it as a Mother's Day gift for my mom. She uses it to play mahjong. I hope it will be useful.
Delivery is too slow. Contact the delivery person and no one cares about it. It’s too bad.
"After using it for a few days, I feel that it is generally good after I got it. There are not too many pre-installed software, and sometimes there will be lags. The sound quality is good. The size is just right too"
"The system is smooth, the battery is durable, the sound quality is great, and the screen is clear"
"I have always used Huawei phones, which are good. The resolution is not as good as Apple’s (the requirements are a bit high?). I bought this for my children. It’s very good."
"Not satisfied, one star, no more"
"Just got it, purchase limit and price reduction, application for price protection failed"
"It broke down just a few days after I bought it. The after-sales service said that the unlocking test was not covered by the warranty. The problem with the machine was said to be man-made. When I took it out of my pocket, I found that the whole body was too hot to run. The Huawei p9,"
Disappointed. The workmanship is poor and the upper and lower parts are misaligned. big black circle
"Not bad, fast delivery, guaranteed quality, good experience"
I will never drink Mengniu again. . . I pooped a dozen times a day. . . It’s uncomfortable. . .
Mengniu proves itself: Mengniu is more cheating than cutting cakes Retweeted on Weibo
Huawei Honor x2 has really good quality and fast running speed. Huawei Honor is worth showing off.
"Supporting domestic products, Huawei's products are affordable. Personally, I think this screen is a bit too big and a bit heavy to hold. It's still good to use, 5 points"
This is my first time using a Huawei product. I just received it and am currently using it.
The picture is clear and the effect is very good when used to fly DJI P4P
Bad quality! Low phase and slow response! ! ! ! !
The tablet is very good. I gave it to a friend and liked it very much. I will come again next time.
"It's brand new and authentic, good"
"Very good product, Huawei is the best. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The courier has a good attitude and enthusiasm, and the packaging is very tight."
Supermarkets still sell Mengniu products normally
"Online shopping is risky, so be careful. Anyway, I will never trust Huawei again... I advise everyone to feel more at ease when buying valuable items after checking them in a physical store..."
"Bought this for my little niece, it’s pretty good, it’s enough for a kid~"
"It’s still a very good product, and the clarity is great. I bought it for my mother to watch TV series, and she’s very satisfied with it."
"Mengniu, your milk has become useful and we are no longer afraid of boycotts."
The tablet is great! I have been using Huawei series products for a long time.
"Bought for my dad, the screen is very big. also very clear"
The camera can’t see clearly even when taking pictures!
Very average. . . . . . . . . .
"Frequently crashes, often crashes"
"The configuration is so-so, lags often occur, and the battery is not durable. It needs to be charged five times in two days. It is far from the official propaganda."
Stop talking about mozzarella cheese. It would be great if you can buy Mengniu chocolate-flavored breakfast children's cheese at Carrefour! I cried when I bought Yili smoked cheese!
"Yes, exactly what I want"
"I don’t want to talk anymore, I’m tired"
"Installed it, but haven't used it yet."
"It's very easy to use. It's about the size of a book and is suitable for carrying around. However, there are no operating instructions in the package. As a first-time tablet user, I spent a long time searching online to figure out how to exit the current application."
I feel bad that I didn’t receive anything.
"Damn, I like drinking Mengniu now."
"It's okay, the memory is a bit small, but you get what you pay for. It's for the elderly, just basic ones! !"
"I placed an order on November 21st and didn’t receive the goods until November 27th. It takes two hours to take a bus from Chengdu to Guang’an. The delivery took 7 days. When I placed the order, it said it would arrive tomorrow. When I placed the order, it said it would come with a protective case. I didn’t send it to Jingdong. Now it’s really bad."
All I can say is that this tablet is so bad that I really regret buying it. It’s better to buy Xiaomi’s. The screen doesn’t work and I can’t click where I want it to after several times. Don’t buy it. It’s a scam.
"I received the goods, I am very satisfied, the logistics is very fast, the customer service attitude is very good, there are gifts, good reviews, 5 points in total, I will come back if needed."
"I have been using it for a few months and it is very good. The screen is big, the quality is good, the response is fast, and the battery is durable. I hope it will last longer. Huawei's progress is obvious to all."
I guess someone else's returned product was sent to me.
"Bought for my son, it works well"
It’s not worth the price. It’s a product that was returned by someone else. It’s obviously unopened. It’s a very unpleasant purchase.
"Bought this for my mother, it’s of great quality and runs well, I’m satisfied!"
I don’t understand why Mengniu refuses to admit its mistake? Not all cows can fool people!
"Very useful, I think"
The tablet is average and gets stuck when playing simple games.
"Not great, no plastic packaging."
Let Mengniu die
"The performance of the tablet is mediocre, and it suffers from lag when watching high-definition movies. The back will feel warm."
"Battery power, call signal is not very good!"
"Reply: Mengniu is poisonous. Unless you offend me, you won’t be ruthless. Just use Mengniu next time."
Want to buy one? Mengniu or Yili? !
Support Mengniu going abroad
Give it to the elderly. My family likes it very much. I trust Huawei.
Mengniu has been bypassed for a long time. One pound of milk per day can bring down the Chinese people. The unscrupulous company should have shut down. Mengniu has been boycotted for a long time. It is only reasonable for this kind of company to go bankrupt. . Boycotting Mengniu starts with me!
The screen has a dead pixel. . . . well! ! !
Not a bad product.
"Niu Gensheng, will you die? Mengniu dares to say that it only harms the inland Chinese?"
"It was clearly marked with 16g of memory, but I found it only had 10g! Don't tell me the system takes up 6 gigabytes!"
Super bad review. I don’t even want to give 1 star for JD.com’s service. I just want to know when it will go bankrupt!
"Garbage, bad reviews, bad reviews. It is advertised that you can watch the Sohu Video VIP blockbuster, but you can't actually watch it at all. I contacted customer service many times and passed the blame. After several days, there was no result. Jingdong Mall's after-sales rights protection is too tiring and difficult."
That's natural! She and Fahrenheit have made great contributions to Mengniu Sour Yogurt! That’s the spokesperson for the first season! It should be quite a pleasure to work together! There are benefits to having a good relationship!
"I buy a carton of milk for 3.5. I now drink three yuan worth of milk every day, hoping to be safe and not poisoned to death. . . I would not dare to drink Mengniu Yili even to death. If you want to commit suicide slowly, you can try it."
"The picture is exquisite, the sound effect is good, the use is smooth, and the logistics is awesome"
"I really don’t want to use it, the resolution is too low, the fonts are blurry, and it’s an unpleasant purchase."
Good Mengniu! !
The delivery was fast. I bought it for my children and the size is suitable. I am very satisfied with it now. Support domestic products!
"The workmanship is exquisite and the feel is good. Needless to say about the quality, the phone is P9plus."
"I wrote that I would send a leather case and a tempered film, but nothing would be mailed, and I would treat people like fools!"
"It's okay, I haven't tried using the card to make calls yet, but the flashlight is different, it's like a screen!"
A very good purchase! Fast delivery! Product quality is good! Big brands are trustworthy!
The stuff is pretty good. I like the quality. Great screen
"It’s okay, kids can play games or watch videos."
"The charger interface is terrible, the charger cable is broken, in short it’s terrible! ! ! ! ! ! difference difference difference"
Jingdong’s delivery is still very fast. The tablet is very good. It’s a little thinner than I expected. Great. High praise.
"It’s not easy to use, so I bought it for someone else."
"Is it funny? The film and machine cannot be sent together, which is nonsense."
"The phone is pretty good, the only thing is that it can't make calls"
The packaging is too poor and there is no protection at all
"Received it this morning! It's good, but it doesn't have a protective cover. It would be better if it comes with a protective case."
Nice buy for my father
"I bought it for my children to learn English with children's fun dubbing, but the last two sentences just couldn't be pulled out and it didn't match up. I was so angry! Don't say it's a problem with the Children's Fun Dubbing APP, both the Xiaomi and iPad are normal!"
"Very average, the fluency is average, to be honest!"
Chinese people really drink too much Mengniu and are becoming more and more mentally retarded. Retweeted on Weibo
"Not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad"
"A birthday gift for the elderly at home, I really like it!"
"Mine has no headphones or protective cover, low pixels, and unclear screen. I regret it so much."
"Mengniu’s is also good, not all iPhone5s are called Deluxe"
"The delivery speed is fast, the customer service attitude is good, and many geniuses have been used to evaluate it. It is very good and supports Huawei."
Been using it for a while and it’s pretty good! Big brands are big brands
What kind of crap is it? It’s broken. Jingdong said it was not self-operated by Jingdong and wouldn’t accept it. The customer service of the store told Jingdong to ask. Jingdong Dakeng
The delivery is very slow. This is the last time I bought something from JD.com.
Mengniu's state-owned enterprise is a smart move. Only nationalization can guarantee Mengniu's success for a century. profound!
"Bad review, I bought it for my mother, but it often played various advertisements, and the elderly couldn't turn them off. It’s really a bad review and I despise Huawei!"
"The advertisement of CCTV6 movie channel is very interesting, it goes like this - Mengniu Daguoli welcomes you to watch Yili Golden Classic Film Appointment. via.Huoye CCTV6 movie channel"
The logistics is super fast and the items are very useful.
"Not bad, but I should have bought the call version. I didn’t have any extra cards at the time, but I regret it now."
"Too bad, they don’t even have basic headphones."
"For the elderly, it is very useful for reading news and WeChat! Playing Honor of Kings is also good, but the system is still limited by 3G memory and is not particularly smooth. A higher configuration is recommended."
It's very smooth to use now. I don't know what will happen in the future. The photo effect is also good!
"The price dropped just a few days after I bought it, which is really annoying."
"Mengniu President Sun Yiping's mid-term customer meeting on August 4th was very strong, and the future of employees is bright."
"I placed an order near noon today. My sister received the goods in the evening. Well, the price was immediately reduced by * yuan. Is this a scam for us consumers? There are pictures to prove it! Please give me an explanation. We don’t even have enough time in the day!"
"The reason for the negative review, what about the No. 1 headphones? , did you call customer service for a second reply? ? , where is the third LeTV membership card? Everyone else has mine? ?"
"It's stuck, it's stuck when watching TV, it's super slow."
"Nice, perfect product, perfect shopping experience"
"The overall feeling is that if you can't make a cost-effective tablet, just don't make it, and you can't fool people either."
"There is no negotiation for negative reviews, and there is no charger. If you ask the seller for advice, be careful."
"The order placed at 2pm was received the same evening! This is my first time using Huawei, you will know after you try it!"
"Good reviews, fast delivery, next day delivery. I trust JD.com and feel that JD.com is trustworthy. I buy all daily necessities from JD.com."
"It's not easy to use, freezes, and often disconnects when answering calls. No, it always disconnects after two minutes. I hope it can be solved."
"I don’t have a jacket, so I feel like I don’t need it. It’s a very cost-effective tablet that has all the functions such as making phone calls. It’s good for the elderly."
"A very good tablet, but you get what you pay for. The screen requires a little effort to touch."
The editor is so mean! Too cheap~~ Are you drinking Mengniu or Yili? Big breasted 90s generation looks like Jilin Songhua Lake
"Bluetooth cannot connect, quality control is still not working."
I drank too much Mengniu recently and my chest is a little swollen. . . . I don’t know if I will die! ! ! ! !
"Zhou Dayou is so conscientious. Someone was offering Mengniu yogurt to try out drinks just now. She refused to drink it, saying that Mengniu yogurt was poisonous. . . I'm embarrassed but satisfied!"
"It's a little bit small, for the elderly. The packaging is really bad. If it's thrown on the floor, no one would want it."
"To be honest, the response is slow. The three function keys below are not very easy to use."
The screen quality is terrible and the resolution is crap.
"The appearance of the tablet is still good, but the battery life is limited. The screen is always on for four or five hours before the battery reaches the bottom."
"It’s not like Mengniu, and it’s not quite like Yili either. . What is this?"
"There is no discount on December 12th, but there is a discount today. I cry to death. Although it has nothing to do with the product, I am just sad and want to give a bad review????"
"Like buying a used mobile phone with an old screen, or a mobile phone with a substandard screen, and only found out after using it for two weeks. I have always trusted Huawei, but thought of online shopping failure."
Card! Seriously stuck! Rubbish! ! ! '
"Dead phone, loud hands-free noise"
"It's up to you whether you want it to be good or not, and it's up to me whether you want to buy it or not. I also ask, why is Mengniu so good? @Angel813: Mengniu has repeatedly encountered problems, but no regulatory authorities have punished it, and Mengniu has not apologized. Advertisements are flying everywhere. Why is Mengniu so awesome?"
"I said it after using it for a while. I bought it for my children. It’s okay, but the storage is a bit small. I have to buy a memory card, but that’s the price."
"Very satisfied, relaxed shopping is really reassuring, I will come again."
"The Mengniu Group sponsorship order that I had been waiting for for three weeks was ruined because of my mistake of being five minutes late. Thanks to this lesson, I deeply understand: details determine success or failure."
"The price is in line with expectations. I feel that the screen is very reflective and can be used as a mirror. It is recommended to apply a frosted film so that the display effect will be slightly worse, but at least it will not be reflective."
Express delivery is as fast as ever. The mobile phone is very easy to use. I have already bought N number of them. The standby time is super long.
"It's okay to use, but sometimes the screen will go black. Pressing the power button will fix it."
····Bazhao feels sick to his stomach today... He was harmed by the evil man Mengniu
I bought it for my mother. It’s good and enough for my use. I’ll give it a review after using it for a while!

"The pixels are very bad, the maximum is 3 million, which is similar to the 2 million pixels I bought many years ago. The call sound is very low. I don’t know if it is a refurbished machine. I am not happy with it."
"Good experience, classic and popular model, second purchase."
"Everything is as described by the seller, all 5 points."
It will take a while to evaluate!
"The delivery speed is very fast. I have been using it for two days. The response speed is okay, the appearance is okay, and the phone calls are okay. However, the heating problem is not well controlled."
15 I placed the order in the morning and received it in the afternoon. The memory is large and the picture is clear.
The mobile phone is not good. I have been using it for a while and the mobile phone signal is not good. It is an old mobile phone and it is still so expensive. It is a scam and rubbish.
Everything is fine. Just no earplugs or phone case. set
Installation sucks
"What a bullshit brand, my phone has no signal. All of them are reminders of incoming calls, and they have been repaired several times but cannot be solved."
"Your sister, even if you buy it and do activities the next day, you won’t be prompted on the page! Pure deception!"
What kind of broken pixel is this? Did you send it to me by mistake? Customer service cannot be contacted. Is this a scam?
"So far, the delivery speed and service quality of JD.com’s self-operated products are good. I hope it will get better and better."
The resolution is too low and the specifications are not marked. It is impossible to change to another model.
"I am a loyal fan of Huawei. It is very easy to use. It is good for watching movies and playing games. However, occasionally the body gets hot. It only takes a few minutes to restart or put it on standby."
"The center left shares it with you, little leaf. For milk~~ We will draw three lucky winners, and the prize will be a box of Mengniu Yogurt. Everyone is welcome to vote."
"The stuff is very good, I like it very much. I’ve used it and I’d like to give it a good review!"
"Hurry up, the guy is very enthusiastic and the stuff is pretty good, great! ! !"
"I have been using it for more than half a month, and it is really easy to use. The sound quality and smoothness are very good. I have always liked Huawei. I am here to express my love for Huawei (?y??)~* covering my mouth and snickering"
"After drinking it, I found that I still like to drink Mengniu."
The logistics is very fast and the customer service attitude is very good. I have been using it for a few days. It heats up quickly and keeps warm very well. I like it very much. I will come back next time if I need it.
Third-party delivery is too slow
"I've been using the phone for a few days, and it feels okay. But the camera is terrible. The pixels are not as high as 13 million, and the phone runs slowly? It's not as good as it says. I suspect it's not a genuine brand? ? ? ????"
"The payment was made on September 16th, and the goods arrived on September 22nd. After receiving the goods, the price was immediately reduced. You guys are really cheating! ! !"
"Good stuff, good value for money."
"The screen is uneven and the film cannot stick to it. There is no way to test it after the sale, so I have to use it first."
"The appearance is very beautiful, I am very satisfied with it, and the battery is durable"
Mengniu is in tragedy
It's a pity not to endorse Mengniu. The cars next to them are full of milk models...
"Very good, good, good"
"I'm really speechless. I'm also stuck. I'm stuck when playing Lianlianxiao and Xiaoxiaole. Sometimes the freeze freezes me. I'm so depressed. Many times I want to smash the phone directly. There's no good product at a cheap price. Apart from the lag, everything else is fine."
"It feels good in the hand. My wife is watching videos practicing yoga, and my son is watching Youku cartoons."
"Mengniu is also a bit too good-looking. If I don’t like the packaging, I definitely won’t buy it."
I bought the second one and installed it the next day.
"Just after using it for a day, the buttons failed and the switch failed! No response no matter how hard I press it, I have to connect the charger to turn it on."
The most unsatisfactory purchase on JD.com. I suspected it had been opened. There was no sealing film on the outside of the phone box.
"The people of the country are ignorant and COFCO is awesome. ""Why Mengniu's performance decline is blamed on negative reports"" (from http:t.cn/zW1yV6c"
What's the point of not being able to touch more when playing Honor of Kings?
"After you drank my yogurt, I went to buy some more. Haha, I was so happy looking at this pile of sourness. Come to my house and drink yogurt. You’re welcome. ^?_?^#Mengniu#Should you give me something? Reward"
"Just used it, feels good"
I placed an order on JD.com last night and received it at 10 o'clock this morning. It's really good. Huawei's quality is trustworthy. It's great.
"It is easy to insist on boycotting Mengniu, but it is not easy to insist on staying away from capsules... In the summer, I found that Huoxiang Zhengqi Liquid... was so bitter that I was ecstatic..."
"The pixel workmanship is very poor, I don’t know why."
"It was NT$50 more expensive when I placed the order a few days ago, but now it’s only NT$949, ??and I can’t apply for price insurance. I'm speechless, too lazy to back out, troublesome. An unpleasant purchase."
"Before buying, it was clearly stated that there was a gift, but after buying it, there was no gift. I contacted customer service and just played a word game. It doesn't matter, gifts are a small thing, deception is a big thing."
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.
"Maybe the price ratio is there, the resolution is not very high, but it’s pretty good for us Taobao users! Anyway, I think it’s pretty good!"
"I can’t even return it if I want to, and I can’t even install the software."
The appearance and craftsmanship are good! Good feel! The playback clarity is also good! Great sound quality!
"I will comment after using it for a month. To be honest, there is probably no other brand that can match this price."
"Mengniu + handmade biscuits are a good combination, review slowly @ ?????"
"Huawei Honor Tablet 7-inch mobile phone is really good. First of all, it is genuine and of good quality. I have not encountered any problems during use. It is a trustworthy product. I hope you will buy it!"
" was added in the wrong place, boycotted Mengniu ""for many years"""
I wonder why there are no headphones. What the hell is this. What reason. Please explain to the merchant.
"After dinner, I planned to buy a Deluxe, but it turned out to be 7 yuan. Sister from the cafeteria in the canteen, did you bargain the price? It’s 7 yuan, 7 yuan for a bottle of Tao Yuan. Decisively changed to Mengniu"
It’s okay. It’s enough for daily use by playing games and watching videos.
It's very smooth to use and worth the money.
Is it hooliganism to buy a mobile phone without earplugs?
"Hey~ Mengniu Yili’s two black-hearted milk factories are not short of money! You won’t know if you don’t look at it, but you will be shocked when you look at it. Repost Weibo"
"Sold two of them together, they work great"
The screen blur occurs on the third day of use of the tablet after I bought it. Will the screen blur occur every day after using it?
I bought it for three days with a discount and refused to return it. You are talking nonsense and are a liar! Everyone will still go to physical stores to buy them in the future.
"The water supply at home has been out for almost a week. I have to carry tap water back from work every day after get off work, and the bathroom smells like preserved eggs. Finally, I deeply understood the meaning of Mengniu’s advertising slogan – Just for a little bit of happiness"
"Damn it’s only half a month old and it’s so cheap*JD. Are you bullying me on purpose? No repeat business? I go to JD.com every day and you do this? Angry and sad, the cheap price is so outrageous that I won’t go to JD anymore."
"It's so abominable, buy 2488 at 618, sell 2388 after 618"
Jingdong orders are really fast! Bought at 7 or 8 am and arrived at 5 pm! decisive praise
"Good system, easy to use and fast"
"Nothing was given, just a machine and a charger. Jingdong made me speechless."
"I placed the order last night and received it this morning. I just used it and it runs very well. I hope it will continue to be like this in the future. The tablet is not heavy, about the same weight as the Meite 9. It is easy to operate and the screen is clear."
That's it for this price. It’s okay to play children’s songs to your children
"Reliable quality, considerate service, top quality, guaranteed to be genuine."
"I want to commit suicide and drink Mengniu~ Brother, you can’t ruin yourself like this when you are broken up~~Redirect"
"The tablet runs fast, fingerprint unlocking is fast, and the system runs smoothly. I placed the order on 6.18 and it arrived the next day. I am very satisfied."
"The black borders are not scary, they are available in movie theaters. Can be ignored. Very useful."
"The goods have been received, everything is OK"
"The same size is much smaller than Apple's, and it was not delivered on time. It's not a special period, so why not arrange delivery?"
"The page was taken, and it turned into m2 when I woke up. This is a scam, please be careful and don’t be fooled again."
"I am still used to the taste of Mengniu. Even if Guangming is extra strong, it still tastes like nothing else. . . . . I'm in #?????# http:t.cn/zODXlH1"
"It's like a big mobile phone, but the picture quality is still good and the quality is guaranteed. This one cannot make calls"
The express delivery is very fast. It is in the debugging stage. It is relatively thin and has good quality. I just don't know what the power consumption is.
It was defective when I received it. I was very dissatisfied and did not return it. It can be used.
"Yeah, the prizes for the activities are okay, use them and see."
"Chen Xinhong is so considerate. He gave his fan girl's boyfriend a way out. If he couldn't afford Audi SS concert tickets to give to his girlfriend, it doesn't matter, so just buy a bottle of Mengniu Sour Yogurt to please his girlfriend:)?"
good very good very good
"It's okay, but the camera is not that good. The battery life is satisfactory. Playing 2 kings consumes 10% of the battery."
It is inconvenient to listen to calls and the touch screen is not sensitive. . . . .
Booting is a bit slow. The screen is large and the sound is clear. Overall not bad
I have been drinking Mengniu and have never been surpassed. I really like this packaging
"High-end configurations have more complete functions. It is recommended that if you have money, it is better to get high-end configurations!"
I bought it for a friend and it’s very good. I have an M2 myself and this upgraded version is very powerful.
It's too small. I regret it. I want to change it. The screen is too small and it doesn't look good.
"I can’t complain about the configuration, it’s so rubbish and it freezes to death when playing games. It's okay to watch videos and listen to music. If you mainly play games, don't choose this. Too stuck"
The sound is getting quieter and quieter. I really don’t want to give it one star. I have to wear headphones when watching movies and listening to music.
"Is it really that good, haha. If something goes wrong, everyone will know. This big JD.com"
"The screen flickers when watching TV, which is not good. The price is not worth it. It’s a huge loss."
It’s so scary... so disgusting... I swear I won’t drink Mengniu milk anymore... Consumers found live worms after drinking Mengniu milk
"Less than ten days after I bought it, oh my god, the battery can’t last a day, and the phone starts to become laggy. There is always a little red light flashing all the time. Even when the battery is full, it starts to go bad???"
"The product is okay, but there are no headphones."
"I can’t say more. Huawei’s after-sales service was recommended to JD.com’s after-sales service. No one paid attention to it all afternoon. I’m speechless! ! ! It's just like this when you open the package. I don't know how to do it, right?"
It’s a new machine. Buy with confidence.
"The screen is big, it’s so cool to watch TV and play games, hahahahaha"
"The mobile phone is rubbish for taking pictures, slow to focus, white, blurry images, rubbish for listening to music, the mid-frequency is blurry, and the high-frequency is harsh. I regret buying it very much."
The price and quality are okay. It is genuine and well packaged. It is good for children to use for learning. The express delivery is fast and I can’t say it. It was delivered on the day after the order was placed. It arrived on the same day as the order was placed. I give you a thumbs up for the delivery brother.
"Not bad, beautifully made, very thin and feels good in the hand."
"High quality and low price, fast delivery, delivery man has a good attitude"
The resolution is too low
There is a problem with the cache and the quality is very average.
"There may be a problem with the system, and text messages are often not received. Automatically restart frequently. The screen is fragile."
Things look good and logistics is fast. Take a while and look again.
No one will patronize such a stingy store anymore.
"Bought on Double 11, not much discount. It hasn't been installed yet, so I'm just stocking up. I wonder if after-sales service will be available when the installation time comes? Good reviews first."
"Mengniu, don’t buy it"
It’s not bad. It’s the most enjoyable to watch videos.
Bad review! The gift shown is not given
The delivery is pretty fast and the size is great for mobile phones
The baby is very good and easy to use. I like it very much.
"Reply Every time I mention Mengniu~he will appear after a while. Hello, thank you for your love for Mengniu products. I am Mengniu WeChat customer service. Welcome to follow me."
"Not long after I bought it, the speaker broke."
"Seriously bad reviews, the price was reduced the night after I bought it. Didn't say a word at all, went to customer service and didn't pay attention."
I advise everyone not to buy this phone. It bends automatically and there is no after-sale warranty. It will be frustrating to use.
Isn’t it written as 16G? I received 11G.
"Just received the item, so far it's OK. No problem. Waiting for the test of time?"
Jingdong customer service is all dead...
"This is my first time flying Air China. It’s so high-end. The rice is also very high-end. The fruits are cantaloupe and orange, Mengniu yogurt, fish and rice, side dishes and smoked ham, and meal packages~"
"Let’s talk about it after using it. Anyway, I’m using Huawei products. This is my first time using a Huawei tablet."
"It's ok, the running speed is ok, it's inconvenient not to have fingerprints"
"The tablet is pretty good. I bought it for someone else. He said that if he uses it for a while and it is still good, he will buy another one."
"The delivery speed was originally very fast, but because it happened on June 18, the express arrived one day late. In order to evaluate the quality of this tablet, I gave it five stars."
"It's not a question of money, it's a question of integrity."
"I was so dizzy that after working on it for a long time, I realized it was a phablet, not a tablet. It was a mobile phone with an 8-inch screen. Please explain that I bought so many things on JD.com and finally saw them today..."
Very good. I bought it as a gift for a friend. It is branded by Huawei and has good quality and good value for money.
It's so stuck**
Clear picture quality and good sound quality
"Domestic Huawei is quite reliable, but why does *'s mobile phone's wifi fail so hard? It can't even load web pages on two wifi bars. My *nokia can use one wifi bar on it. Can you be more careful?"
"Not bad, not bad, good value for money. It’s not bad if I use Apple a lot and use Android."
"Very good tablet, very easy to use, satisfactory and smooth to use. No headphones."
"The sound quality of this tablet is good in all aspects, good, good. Huawei has always trusted JD.com. This tablet does not heat up and is a good TV for playing games. It is worth buying."
"Black becomes bigger. As for my other skills, I can’t tell them clearly through translation."
Deluxe</Feature
"Very good, very satisfied, this is the second time I bought it!"
"I bought the Honor 1 before, but I always felt that the standby time of the Honor 2 was not as long as the Honor 1. I just had to make do with it. Huawei didn’t give me anything, which was stingy."
Any banner feedback on local archaeological excavations?
"The quality is so bad that when it fell to the floor from a height of 30 centimeters, the screen was shattered. I will firmly boycott Huawei."
It runs very fast and is good for watching movies. A good choice. Good~
"I have two iPads at home, but it is inconvenient to transfer things to Apple, so I chose the Huawei tablet, which is easy to operate and import data. Huawei's workmanship is very good. I love so much"
"The outer packaging is too simple, there is no padding, just a flat tablet in a cardboard box. I'll evaluate it after using it."
"Very good, very convenient to use"
"As soon as I opened it, I found that there was an image taken in January. The production date was indeed 2017.03. It was so ****."
"The resolution of this product is really bad. If I could choose it again, I would never buy it~~"
"After Yili, there will be Mengniu and Guangming. Do we have to finish the darshan?"
I have been using it for just over a month and there are all kinds of problems. The after-sales service is rubbish. I was told to send it back for repair in 30 days!!! What phone should I use during this period? ? Why can't I complain?
Not bad~ I haven’t used it yet~ I’ll try it when I move to a new house~ I’ll give it a good review~
The battery didn't last a day and the screen kept changing between bright and dark. The quality is not good.
"How many things have happened, and you still buy Mengniu and Yili! Only buy real estate for three yuan! My grandson won’t buy Mengniu anymore."
"#walkintomengniufactory# The milk I tasted was good, thank you @????weekly"
"After only using it for more than a month, the speaker of the phone has gone silent, and only the earpiece can produce sound. I really regret buying it."
"The goods haven’t arrived yet, so there’s a price difference of 50 yuan. No refund, only the Beijing voucher, which can’t be used immediately."
"I placed the order the day before and it arrived the next morning. Such speed. After looking at it for a while, I saw that it was good, mainly for children to play with."
A tablet in this price range is quite good and is enough for watching videos. Support Huawei
"The packaging is simple, just a plastic bag, and the mobile phone package has been opened. I wonder if it is second hand."
"The tablet is very good, I like it very much"
"What a broken platform. On such a big holiday as June 18, the price is more expensive than usual."
"It’s for babies to play with, it’s pretty good after using it for a while"
"Why are there no gifts, and there is no factory protective film on the screen after opening the box? Is this the same for everyone else? And it’s extremely slow to upgrade once you get it? What is going on?"
"One word, too slow, King of Glory can get stuck, alas"
"The product has been received and has not been used yet. After opening it, it looks good and is not damaged. Trust JD.com and Huawei. Come on!"
It's garbled when booting up. Bad difference
"Excellent workmanship, clear screen, but lags often occur"
The pixels are not good and downloading software is not good either.
The mobile phone is genuine. I like it very much. I bought it for my wife. My friend also asked me to buy it on JD.com. It was a good purchase.
The product was received. I gave the courier 10068 likes. The product quality is pretty good and my husband likes it very much.
"Very quickly, very fast. Will visit again next time"
"JD.com is so fast. If you place an order at 10 a.m., it will arrive at 6 p.m. This is my first time buying a Huawei product, and I found that the domestic brand is as powerful as Apple, fast, suitable in size, and more user-friendly. praise!"
"It feels good to use, the screen is large and clear, and 4G calls and Internet access are good. I bought it to play Live 2012. The Android version is too high and I can’t install it. Except that it feels a little expensive, everything else is good."
Mengniu’s PR is pretty good! Take down Sina! It probably cost a lot!
"Jingdong’s self-operated products are good, the quality is guaranteed, and the logistics speed is fast enough. If you place an order at 11pm, you can receive it at noon the next day. good! Other logistics are incomparable! From now on, when buying things, I will buy it from JD.com."
"It's a bit heavy, and the screen is big. I wish I had bought a 7-inch one. I'm not used to such a big screen. The music effect is particularly good, and it supports domestic production. The color is also perfect, I love it!"
"It's not easy to unlock the phone by swiping the screen. It takes several swipes to unlock. Also, the phone doesn't look like a new one. The screen protector has already been put on after it arrived. Overall, I'm not satisfied."
"I personally think it is easier to use than others, it is sensitive and responsive, and the memory running speed is better. It is suitable for watching movies and working. I like it very much."
"Bought this for my dad, so far it's working fine."
"It's okay. After all, Android tablets are all pretty much the same. The sound quality really doesn't matter. It just feels like a big phone."
"It is understandable that the machine itself has low configuration, but it is unacceptable that the software downloaded from the Huawei App Store cannot be installed, so I can only give a one-star negative review."
I received the electric water heater and checked it carefully. The quality is very good. The customer service attitude is also good and the delivery is fast.
It’s too bad. It’s not enough after 8 hours of charging. The resolution is too bad. It hurts my eyes. It’s stuck. The screen responds slowly. I clicked it for a long time and it didn’t move. It doesn’t respond. It’s frustrating. It’s a waste of money. Those who want to buy it should take a good look at the packaging. too concise
I bought it for my dad. The screen is big enough and he likes it very much.
"Frequent restarts, there are quality problems! ! !"
Been using it for a while! good! value for money
I am a loyal fan of Huawei and trust JD.com. This is already the third one. My friend also wants one. I tried it out and was quite satisfied. Wait for New Year’s Day and there will be a discount | It’s worth waiting a little longer! ! ! !
"Wow, thank you very much. I will pay more attention to Mengniu in the future and buy Mengniu milk haha"
"The goods were received very quickly. The goods are great. Jingdong logistics is really fast. The baby likes it very much at first sight, but it is a pity not to send headphones."
It’s just that Mengniu drank too much
The resolution is really not average and the actual effect is poor
"Domestic flights call for food. When people see international flights, they think they are planes returning from disaster relief. This year, I would rather transfer 4 times to HK instead of going to BJ for CA. In addition to Mengniu milk, there are also incredibly unpalatable Chinese food."
"So disgusting,"
"He didn’t drink Mengniu. He was another person who committed suicide by drinking fake medicine. At this time, he should thank the fake medicine. Young people cherish their lives."
"It looks pretty good, but it’s a bit stuck when watching TV. I don’t know why. It can’t be watched on other mobile phones and tablets."
"The website is falsely advertised, the bracket is mentioned on the website, and the leather case has nothing. They are all lies and customer service cannot solve any problem."
It feels good when I turn it on. The previous 10.1-inch one felt too big. This one feels good in hand and has a good picture.
"This is my first time buying a tablet, so I’m not getting used to it, so I need to evaluate it."
I've been using it for two days and it's still ok.
"I can only say one word, value for money!"
"I got the thing, it looks good, it would be nice if I could give it a case."
"Very nice, fast and well made"
Super beautiful. Mainly for children to watch animations. Watch for half an hour to an hour every day. It can be charged for several days.
Super slow. It took several days to arrive. Not easy to use.
Your sister! It’s only been a few days and the price has been reduced to * to compensate me! Bad review!
"Baby received. It feels good, give it a thumbs up first. Follow up after using it"
"Dad’s Father’s Day gift, haha, the old man is very happy. The tablet display is excellent and everything runs smoothly, which is very Huawei. A film was given as a random gift, the quality is excellent."
"It feels pretty good, please give it a good review!"
I don’t want to give a single star to someone who can’t play the game. It’s garbage.
Mengniu changes packaging? It feels so fresh! beautiful day
Beijing Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo East
Perfect for playing games and watching movies
"The packaging is not good, too simple. All can be opened."
Lenovo is trustworthy and I firmly believe that Lenovo is much better.
"It reminds me that some time ago, Huawei used stock chips for its flagship phones. . . I think you need to reflect on it, not only if you are immersed in making products, but you should also reflect on after-sales service!"
"Jingdong is garbage, product garbage, service garbage, integrity garbage!"
"Installed, haven’t used it yet, it feels pretty good"
"I like the tablet very much. It’s very beautiful. My mobile network is not very good. This Huawei computer has very fast network speed. I couldn’t connect to the one I bought before, so I returned it. I support Huawei’s domestic products. I will also buy Huawei mobile phones in the future."
The system is very fast. I installed a few applications in just a few seconds. It feels very smooth. I haven’t upgraded the system yet. I listened to a few songs. The overall sound quality is very good. It feels very good. It’s worth the price.
It's good. I've been using it for a while before I can evaluate it. It's very fast and has a large memory. It's pretty good.
Overall it's pretty good! It's just that there are a lot of pre-installed software! The speed is also good and the price-performance ratio is relatively good.
"It took me a while to evaluate it, and it is very smooth. good. Movie watching artifact!"
I am very disappointed with JD.com’s delivery person this time. He actually placed the items in a place I didn’t know and asked me to pick them up myself. I was speechless and had a bad review from the delivery person!
"Very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good"
Have you ever tried Yili or Mengniu’s Lili milk? It’s banana-flavored. Bingerui’s banana-flavored milk is always delicious @???
"It’s too bad. It’s not as good as a phone costing hundreds of dollars, and it’s laggy when playing games. A very failed online purchase. . ."
"If you see it, please forward it. Boycott inferior Mengniu!"
Don’t buy Mengniu at all!
"It's just that it's stuck, but everything else is fine."
Mengniu supports you! Love you! Support you!
This is rubbish. This is the rubbish tablet I have ever bought. The touch screen has become insensitive after just a few days of use.
The things are second-hand. black screen splash screen
The child likes it very much and can't put it down. It's very good.
"I mainly use it to read PDFs and occasionally watch movies. For personal catching up, it is more convenient than the iPad~"
"If I didn't need one star to evaluate, I wouldn't give it one star. What rubbish."
"In any self-operated store, sometimes there are gifts and sometimes there are not. It’s extremely troublesome to return the goods, just forget it and you won’t have it. But there is no denying that I feel unhappy inside. . . . . Not satisfied with the shopping process"
"It’s so deceptive. I said, why did it disappear after two sips? It turns out there is a lot of articles in it. How can you deceive consumers like this? I can only say: Mengniu, you are so unkind."
The price was reduced just after I bought it. I called several times but got no reply. Is there any solution? ? ?
"I placed an order last night and it will arrive today. Please see the pictures. There is not even a minimum of bubbles in the box. This is Jingdong! Outrageous! Is this how you treat old customers? The last time I swear, get out of Jingdong!"
"The resolution is too poor, I suggest you don’t buy it. It’s a bit laggy when playing games. I *just bought it after a flash sale* and applied for price protection. They said it was out of stock, but the JD.com website still has it in stock and you can place an order. JD.com is really a liar."
"Even Mengniu can't resist it, and they still boycott Japanese products. Regardless of national boundaries, those who rob are scum."
It took me a few days to evaluate it. It’s okay. The most important thing is to give the courier guy 12 thumbs up. His service attitude is very good...
The pixels of the phone are really terrible. It has only been used for less than two months and it is no longer working on standby. The speaker is very small when the earpiece is turned on. I recommend you not to buy it. They say it will be repaired. The repair will take a long time and it is really troublesome.
One bottle a day. Drink. But I like to drink Mengniu~~~~
"Bad review, bad review! ! ! If there are zero stars, I must give a zero! !"
"The stuff is pretty good, worth it, and not expensive either."
"Not bad, my dad likes it"
"The delivery is fast and the courier has a good attitude. Tablets are okay. The April machine doesn’t even have a film on it, not even a simple layer of protective tape!"
It’s not good. I just download a game and it freezes. It’s so rubbish. It’s not as good as a mobile phone. I feel dizzy even when I’m watching a movie.
"I placed the order yesterday afternoon and received it this morning. Only JD Express is so awesome. The tablet is beautiful, really beautiful. The system runs fast and smoothly. It doesn't lag when watching movies or playing games. It's well worth the price."
Logistics is fast. I haven’t used the phone yet. I will review it after I use it.
"Bought this for my husband. Under the light, there are obvious signs of use in the card slot, so I seriously suspect it is a second-hand phone. Bad review! I’ve been buying things on JD.com for so long. This is the first time I’ve encountered this situation. It’s so frustrating."
"The tablet is not bad, but the express delivery is very slow. It took 3 days to arrive beyond the expected time. It is very unpleasant to have to wait for 3 days in vain."
"Looks good and feels good, I like it very much"
"I am doing Android development. The company bought a test machine. I didn’t know you were a Huawei. The automatic background download program is also 66. These days, quality is not as good as marketing."
"Nice tablet, fast Internet speed, fast running speed, very beautiful"
Poor control
The root cause of poor domestic production is not technology but philosophy.
"What about the promised gift? Since customer service doesn’t talk about numbers, why do you need customer service? A very unpleasant shopping."
The quality of Huawei tablet is very good and the size is suitable. I like it very much and support Huawei all the time! !
"I bought this for my baby. I like it very much. I hesitated a lot before and thought it was too small. After I got it, it felt just right. I like it."
"I like it very much, mainly because it doesn’t get stuck and it’s very convenient to take it out."
"Very bad. In less than a month, the price was reduced by 500 yuan. I bought it on February 12th for 3388 yuan. Looking at it on March 6th, it was 2888 yuan. Jingdong is a scam."
"Finally, let me talk about my own opinion: I think M2 is the most mature of all Huawei pads. It has its own personality. Whether it is sound quality, security, exquisite small functions, or operation, it is better than other pads. ."
You get what you pay for. It’s too expensive. It’s not as good as other brands that cost more than 300 yuan. I suggest you buy the good ones.
Have a cup of Mengniu red date yogurt. I like it very much. . . .
"The order I placed in the morning was delivered in the afternoon. The logistics was great. The thing is very good. After playing games for a while, it is very smooth. It is worth the price."
"The mobile phone is currently okay, but the customer service attitude is very poor, so the negative review! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"The logistics is still perfect, but this thing seems to have been used by someone else. The power cord is exposed and there are marks on the screen. It took a long time to clean it up."
"The screen display is very clear, so it’s absolutely no problem to watch movies and so on!"
No milk... I can only poison myself by eating Mengniu... Tragedy
"Got the second one, it's good and easy to use."
Mengniu should never have been left out.
"In fact, Mengniu still cares about credibility."
This is really good. It supports domestic products and makes Chinese people self-reliant and self-sufficient.
"Good reviews, specially used for playing games 233"
"The order I placed last night was delivered to my home this morning. It was really fast. I have tried the tablet and it feels good. I am quite satisfied with the response speed, clarity and sound quality."
"It's different from the one I bought before. Especially when playing offline videos, it's very stuck. I can't watch them at all. I don't know why."
"Not for the product, only for JD.com’s customer service, after-sales service is terrible"
"The Samsung tabs I used before were broken, so I replaced them with Huawei M3, which is a few hundred yuan cheaper. I have used it a few times, and the performance is comparable to Samsung tabs. It is worth buying, but Jingdong rarely gives any gifts."
"No lag, very good"
This is the second time I bought it. The quality is very good and it is genuine. The after-sales service is also excellent. Come back next time if necessary. All 5 points!
The photography is not very clear and I am not very satisfied with it. It is not as clear as Apple’s 8 million pixels.
"It's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad."
The resolution is low. Slow response. Others are very good.
Looking forward to Wei Chen being the host of Mengniu Sour Yoghurt Music Chart in 2013. Looking forward to it.
"Bad review, bad review, bad review, only 2G network can't refund"
Good quality and low price. Very cost-effective. A large mobile phone can be used as a pad.
"Okay, but I installed it myself in the countryside. The baby is very good and the whole family likes it."
"Jingdong’s self-operated stuff is good, often used, convenient and fast!"
"I like Mengniu. . . No matter how vicious he is, I still like him. . . I fell in love with it at first sight. . . Then I couldn’t quit. . ."
It's not very slow. I don't have any headphones. I don't have anything with me.
I have been using it for several days and it feels good. The quality is good. It’s a pity that the charging port is not type-c.
"Bought for my son, he likes it very much. Not bad"
Is it good for Mengniu?
"To be honest, it's really bad. It's so hot when charging that it feels like it's going to explode. It's also laggy. In the past, the ZTE that used 600 or 700 yuan didn't have such lag. It didn't even get hot when charging."
Photos taken from the phone glow red. Contacted customer service but still no response. I don’t know who to complain to. Bad review! !
"What a crappy computer, it's stuck no matter what you use it on. I advise you not to buy it. I am an example. I don’t know why he has so many good reviews because he has found so many people to criticize him. I will definitely regret buying it."
"Mengniu, will you die if you add an A? Poor English can kill people~"
"Mengniu’s new packaging is very nice, I’m attracted to it"
"I am very dissatisfied. After using it for only two months, the card slot broke and the telecom card cannot be used."
"I bought two*, and the third one* Oh, JD.com is really..."
I think it’s a waste of money. Please don’t buy it because I’ve only used it for less than a month. It’s very stuck and the response is extremely slow. Oh my god. It’s really bad.
"No, the memory is too small"
Huawei's quality is still very good
good. . . . . . . . . .
"This resolution can only be described as ""scumbag"". Whoever buys it will be fooled. I was still in a daze next to the icon. I was also drunk. This resolution is really unbeatable."
The tablet is too broken and the resolution is too low
"As shown in the product picture P, the black frame on the screen actually has one more black circle than the picture. The upper and lower black edges are actually close to the gold edges in the picture, and the left and right black edges are about 7-8mm."
"Not bad, good value for money, enough for watching videos~"
"The bright spot, the bright field pointed by the finger is inconsistent with the surrounding area!"
"Go to hell, junk food companies—Xu Fu Ji, Mengniu, Shuanghui"
Not so good! The quality is too bad
It only took half a month for the fuselage to bend!
"As good as ever, the price has dropped a lot, it’s worth it! !"
"There was a gift when I placed the order, and it was also displayed during checkout. I received the goods, but where is the gift???? If it’s not in stock, I won’t give it. I’m just confused."
"When I open Youku to watch videos, the response is too long every time I open it. Bad review."
"The battery is durable, the screen is large, the resolution is clear, and there is no lag problem when using the software normally."
"Bought for my mother, she is very satisfied!"
Jingdong garbage
Very poor mobile phone Speechless
"It's very smooth to use when I first got it. The delivery was very fast the next day after buying it. It's a great tablet at this price and it looks classy. I just don’t have headphones, but it doesn’t matter"
The speed is too slow. Bad review.
Not bad. Not bad for the first time!
Bought for the second time.
"The display is really bad, so I returned it."
"If it is true, uninstall all 360 software"
This phone is big enough. It’s like a tablet. It’s okay. It’s enough for daily use.
The baby is very good and the price is very suitable. Good reviews.
"There is no factory film, so I doubt whether it is a new phone. I turned it on and tried it, but it was a bit laggy. Still without downloading any software. Can't give high marks"
Bought for my parents. Parents like it very much. The speed is still relatively fast. I usually watch a lot of TV and the screen is very clear.
"Excellent five-star quality, logistics and delivery"
The delivery was fast. The price was reduced if I bought it before June 18.
"I really don’t recommend it, it will freeze after buying it. It’s really not good for the Android system to stutter as soon as I buy it. Then the video I used to take the exam has no sound when using Huawei video. I didn’t use it much after I bought it, so I should have returned it early."
"Second hand goods. There are obvious fingerprints on the screen. Customer service 37057 refused to process and refused to transfer to the specialist, promised to call the upgrade specialist, but also refused to upgrade."
The system is very smooth and the screen display is high-definition.
I really like the dual speakers. A very satisfying purchase.
I bought it for my sister-in-law for her kids at home. The quality should be good. The one I bought in my sister’s store is the same one. It’s more expensive than JD.com. It freezes after a while. I’m not sure about this one.
"It can be used easily,,,,,,,,,,,"
very good
The tablet is great. It comes with a Samsung 256G card. It’s a great tool for watching videos.
The product is good and the quality is very good. I have used it for several months before I reviewed it. There is no film and the screen is fine at all. It ranks first among domestic products.
Very good. The sound effect is also good. I bought it for the elderly. It is very suitable. You can also use it yourself. The caching speed is also fast. It is worth buying.
I received it. It’s so fast. I placed the order in the morning and it arrived in the afternoon.
"The logistics is good, but there is not even a film, let alone a set. What does this mean? Is it so discounted?"
"It's okay, but the price is not very stable."
"If you want to return the product, please purchase with caution. It's too stuck, and I don't know why the voice can't be sent. Very irritating, customer service attitude is not good either"
"Unlimited black*dong, don’t ask me why, I’m a stupid fan, I buy second-hand from *dong just to give bad reviews!"
This is my first time buying a tablet online and I am getting used to JD.com products.
It's pretty good so far. I don't know how to use it. I'll comment after using it for a few days.
"Very good, good, worth recommending, worth trusting, worth owning, worth buying, like"
"I like shopping on JD.com because if I buy something today, it will be delivered tomorrow."
"Rubbish machine, the signal is extremely poor, the other party always says that he can’t hear clearly when he answers the question"
"If I drink some Mengniu and then Yili, will Mengniu be poisoned to death?"
difference difference difference difference difference difference
Expired membership cards can be given away
"Really good card, very bad tablet. I regret it so much. If you want to buy it, go to a physical store to check it out before buying it."
Shipping is very fast
"After taking a shower, I feel so comfortable and have a bottle of Mengniu. It’s so refreshing!"
"The packaging is nice and the delivery is fast, but I haven’t used it yet and I don’t know how it works."
"The store is not helpful. I just bought it and it turned on well when I got home, but the next day it wouldn't turn on again! I returned it for repair, but it couldn't be repaired. They said the repair cost was more expensive than the purchase price! What a rubbish! Direct negative review!"
"The built-in music cannot be played. When I asked the customer service, they said that even if the account is not logged in, it would not work. They also said that using third-party software, Kugou can, and then asked why the built-in music cannot be played, and the message cannot be sent. Have you blocked me?"
"A good mobile phone, relatively smooth, this is my second purchase. The big screen is fun to use."
The packaging is terrible. It’s just a cardboard box and there’s not even an air bag inside.
"Not good. When watching TV, it’s not very clear and the response is not very sensitive."
Mengniu’s evil thing must spread!
Do you think others won’t recognize you if you change your vest? Definitely not buying Mengniu
"The item has been received, the screen color is good, JD express delivery is great"
The price will be reduced after buying it. Don’t buy it.
"Very good, not bad, not bad"
The black borders are too disgusting. Buy an 8-inch screen and remove the black borders to make a 6-inch screen.
"Bought it for a friend, who said he liked it very much"
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"The garbage is at the extreme level. I just bought it and a white screen appeared less than a month ago. When I asked customer service for after-sales service, they kept shirking their responsibilities and refused to talk to others. They all let the JIMI intelligent robot handle it. I was extremely speechless. Bad review."
It's okay. I don't know if Huawei is not confident or something. They have a bunch of Huawei software that is not allowed to be uninstalled and is not easy to use. Why bother? What kind of society is this? It needs to be open and open. So give it one point. Other OK
MD said that it is 32G and only 24G. I will never go to JD again. He also said that he will give you a power bank for free and you have to pay the shipping fee. I am speechless. It is so unreliable.
"The tablet resolution is rubbish. It’s not good to use. It’s supposed to give you stuff, but it’s not even a film. I’ll fuck you uncle."
"The power automatically shuts off halfway through charging, and the power automatically shuts off halfway through charging. The new phone originally had quality issues and could be exchanged within 15 days. I had to send it in for a replacement, but the customer service was being rogue and said they couldn't exchange it. Damn it, they sent it back again."
It’s okay. My son had a great time.
I bought this for my dad and he said it runs smoothly and the Huawei is great. I don’t know if Android will freeze after using it for a long time.
"I have just used it for two days. It looks good and feels good. The disadvantage is that the system takes up too much memory, using 8G. The resolution is slightly lower, but it is enough; the pigment is low. Overall, a good tablet. Don't know if it's durable or not."
Not easy to use! Slow response and low resolution! I regret buying it!
"The quality is pretty good, the packaging is good, and the delivery is fast"
"Watching the website and playing Honor of Kings are very smooth, the sound quality and picture are good, but it is a little heavy, and the overall cost performance is still very good."
Very speechless......
"The screen is big, very practical and genuine."
I received it in the afternoon. I downloaded various software when I got home from get off work. It's very good and smooth. The dual speakers are really good.
It’s very useful. I played Fantasy Westward Journey and Bright Continent without any lag at all. I like it very much.
"The sound quality is really not outstanding, and the user experience is also good, much better than the youth version."
The size is what you want. The system needs to be cleaned regularly.
It feels ok. Let's try it and watch it. It should be ok. It's normal for electronic products to heat up. The TV is still hot after being watched for a long time.
"I can have a cup of hot milk again before going to bed. It’s so nice to be at home, so happy. I don’t even know that Mengniu has changed its packaging. I haven't drank milk for a long time. ."
"The logistics is very fast, and the elderly are quite satisfied with it. I bought it during an event, but later I found out that the price wasn’t much lower."
A little disappointed. There is nothing except the charger ?_?
"Mengniu Big Fruit is delicious, delicious, delicious~"
"The fever was so severe that I didn’t even open any apps, I was just watching videos. I didn’t say anything about the pixels for the price, but I was promised 2g of memory, and it was so hot that I could pancake while watching videos~~"
"High-quality domestic products, high cost performance, I feel satisfied after trying it!"
"The water heater is great! It’s just that the express delivery didn’t come to your door, only downstairs."
The delivery speed is awesome. Very satisfied with the size
"Trash, delivery is slow, the set is not available yet!"
Share pictures of Mengniu ice cream mooncakes with beautiful packaging and great taste!
"The machine is average. It was very hot when I first got it and used it today, and it didn’t come with anything."
"I received the package in good condition. When I opened it, there were no traces of being dropped. There were scratches on the upper left corner. I was really disappointed."
"As soon as you received the mobile phone, you placed a price and asked for a refund of the difference."
I bought it as a birthday gift for an old man. It has a big screen and long standby time. He likes it!
"I have to replace all my belongings when moving, is that okay?"
The packaging is in good condition and the logistics is fast. I think it’s okay to use the tablet. It’s good to watch TV with a big screen.
It’s worth owning a domestic classic
I guess I'm most worried about Mengniu.
"The express delivery is very fast, but the product is too stuck!"
"In fact, Mengniu is quite down-to-earth. Whatever is on its mind, it is spoken out and told to the whole world."
"Recently, I have become more and more disappointed with JD.com. It is getting worse and worse. Except for the efficiency of delivery, there is really no other choice. As long as it is not urgent, I will basically not choose JD.com... As a senior member, I feel very worried..."
I received the tablet and tried it for a while. I like it very much. It’s what I want. It’s okay for taking pictures. It’s for personal use. I just use it to watch TV.
"Supporting local brands is my consistent style. From the current evidence, I don’t see any problems with Mengniu. If I support local companies, I will buy Mengniu."
"Except for the serious screen smearing when moving the screen, the M3 is good. The system is smooth, the sound is great, and it's great for watching movies."
The machine becomes overheated after 20 minutes of continuous use. An unlucky purchase.
"Speechless, pixels are not good"
This tablet is useless and the material is not good. The back is too slippery and feels bad in the hand
Slow is just one word
"I received the item. The express delivery was very fast. I couldn’t wait to unpack it. I feel that the overall body is quite good in all aspects. At this price, I think it is worth the money."
"The packaging is very poor. The box is not wrapped with plastic film and is deformed. Fortunately, the machine is not broken. The machine is okay, but the screen will darken uncontrollably when taking pictures under strong light. I don’t know if it has been fixed."
"Bad review! Jingdong is like a wet market! One price a day! The price was reduced the day after I bought it, so I’m unlucky."
"Very good, very fast, very powerful. Jingdong is different. I give it five stars. Thank you for the hard work of the courier guys. Thank you for your service. I will come again."
"Very good, cheaper than supermarkets, fast logistics and good service."
"After receiving the goods, I opened it and asked why there was no protective film on the tablet, and there were obvious traces of scratches and fingerprints. It must have been opened and used before. Jingdong should reflect on it!"
"Huawei phones are fine, but this tablet is really bad. Its oversized black borders are unacceptable."
"This tablet does not have a reset button, and it takes a long time to exit the current interface. The screen will go black in a few seconds when writing. Bad review. I strongly do not recommend buying it! ! ! ! ! !"
There’s not even an invoice. It’s too simple. There’s not a single gift. I bought a lot of them last time and the price is about the same. This is too ****.
"I bought it for free as a college student. The product is super good, easy to use and very convenient!"
"The stuff is good, my son likes it very much, it deserves praise"
"The logistics is super fast, the packaging box is a bit loose, but there is still a layer of original packaging inside. The tablet is working fine for the time being."
"Mengniu Niu, you are indeed an idiot. PS: You are not cold and you still have shorts."
"Dongdong is very good, a 7-inch phablet phone, not too big or too small, just the right size, and very fast to use. I like it very much..."
Fast logistics and good quality.
Pirated Mengniu
"The performance of the machine is good, the system runs very smoothly, and it has always supported domestic Huawei products. It is very cost-effective and worth owning. The express delivery was very fast. I received it at noon the next day. It was a very good online purchase."
A good shopping trip. I bought it for a friend. My friend likes it very much.
"Bought for 999 during the event, a good purchase."
"I like this taste, Mengniu Youyi C"
"1.16g of memory is available, 9.68g is too confusing 2. If SIM card 2 is inserted, the SIM card cannot be inserted 3. The pixel effect is average"
"The response of the phone is very busy, which is the same as the Xiaomi phone I have used for 2 years. The phone basically cannot be used when charging and keeps running around. Charge your phone before you want to play with it."
I just received it and have been using it for a day. It feels good for the time being. It is faster than the old iPad at home?
"I have long wanted to use Huawei. This time I bought it and tried it. It is good and smooth enough. If you are concerned about the black edges, I suggest you buy it with caution. After all, the cost of being bezel-less is too high. The price is good value for money. Jingdong’s self-operated services are as good as ever!"
The frame is defective~~~~I don’t know if it was refurbished.
There is no sound from one speaker and the red screen phenomenon is serious!
"The stuff is good, but the leather case I was promised as a gift is out of stock, which makes me feel bad. Why should it be out of stock if it is to be delivered?"
"The goods have been received. As everyone said, the phone is not very good. I suspect it is a second-hand phone. Someone has used WeChat. The screen is still scratched and I am too lazy to return it. It is recommended that everyone do not buy it."
not good! Don’t buy it if it doesn’t have wifi. You can’t use it. You don’t want to give it a single star?
"Things are average, not as good as expected, there are no earplugs, only a mobile phone"
I don’t even have headphones or a screen saver. I’m so speechless.
The machine works well. The cover provided is also very good and feels good in hand.
"It's okay, but the screen is yellow and not as comfortable as the cold screen"
"This store is a lie. Don't buy it. It promised to have free gifts, but when it arrived, it said it didn't have any. It said there were no events in my area! What the hell, it’s just**"
The express delivery needs to be praised!
"Not bad, I bought it for testing. recommend."
"Soon after playing, the video card will appear! The quality is very average! It’s better not to be cheap!"
"JD.com express delivery is really fast. I took the photo at around 9pm and it arrived the next morning. When I got it, I felt it was much better than the Youth Edition. It was perfect for my son to play games with."
Happy departure! Mengniu’s new brand commercial is really good! none
"Change the soup but not the medicine, and even if you change it, you won’t sell it? . . Not as good as the old Mengniu new packaging @ Mr. Yi’s seasoning bottle"
good!
The resolution is too low and the touch is not sensitive. It is almost the same as Xiaomi Mi Pad 2.
"**I won’t buy from JD.com anymore. Not long after I bought it, the screen became like this."
It is a large-sized mobile phone. It can be installed with all Android software. The response is very fast. It is good. It is enough for the children to do their homework. The children like it.
"Very useful, good quality, worth it"
Is this second-hand? There are scratches on the machine.
"Not bad, it works well, runs very fast, not bad. The courier guy has a great attitude and I'm very satisfied!"
This ad from Mengniu is better. Be creative.
This is my second purchase. It’s as easy to use as ever. Huawei phones are good. This one is also low-end.
I have always loved drinking Mengniu pure milk. I have always loved it.
"There's a little bit of lag when playing games, but otherwise it's fine."
"Just got it and it works well for normal use. . . . But after I got it, I realized why everyone complained about Huawei’s ancestral black bezel, which is really eye-catching. . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
I originally wanted to buy the gold 32g model but it was no longer available. Thank you very much to the courier guy for delivering it to the house for the first time and no one was there. He delivered it again in the evening?
"It’s okay, well packaged, and shipped quickly."
It keeps shutting down automatically after using it for a while!
"While we were still on vacation, Mengniu was still working very hard overtime to produce conscientious milk for us. It really ""moved China and the industry""!"
Very good very good
"I recommended this to a friend. The current domestic products are indeed different. In terms of workmanship, quality and performance, they are all perfect. They are no worse than Apple. Come on, domestic products!"
"If you change the soup instead of the medicine, it is better not to change your name so that everyone will think you are not Mengniu."
"Arrived quickly, quite satisfied. Do you mean it comes with a protective cover? Why not?"
"If it weren't for the lowest rating, I wouldn't even give it one star."
The price was reduced within 24 hours of placing the order. I hope the difference can be reimbursed.
So cheap! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
"The stuff is good, the workmanship is excellent, and the running speed is satisfactory. Why is there no invoice? I'll ask customer service during the day."
"Within a month of buying it, I got $* off. The so-called price protection is all fake. They say I have a gift and don’t accept price guarantee. Haha, this one is for a JD friend."
"This phone arrived the next day after cash on delivery, but I helped buy one after it arrived. I paid first and then it arrived, but it was still missing after three days. Not very reputable"
Can't insert card. Disappointed
"Not satisfied with having nothing but a computer. . . . . They are all lies,,,,,,,"
The quality is okay and the price is pretty good
"Mayday’s endorsement of HTC makes me want to buy it. . . Mengniu Sour Yoghurt is also endorsed by Mayday. . . I was excited. . . . Why. . . this. . Chen Xinhong, do you agree? o_O"
"Bought at a special price, very cost-effective, it’s great to use the big screen"
"Bad review, first of all, charging is too slow; secondly, it was 1,258 yuan when I bought it, but it was reduced to 988 yuan a few days later. I applied for a refund of the price difference, and I said I won’t care about it for 7 days! What a heartache!"
"The packaging is relatively simple, but the product is still very easy to use. I used the x1 before and used it for two years. Now I have switched to the x2."
This tablet is not as comfortable and laggy as the broken tablet I had before. My tablet cost just over 500 and it was so stuck.
I use it for ordering food in restaurants. I have bought 10 of them before. The effect is good. But this time there is not even a film on it. I have had it before.
Haven't used it yet. It feels average and there is no invoice. . There will definitely be negative reviews.
"Even though * and * are dozens of yuan cheaper than JD.com, I still chose JD.com’s self-operated products because of my trust. However, I didn’t expect that even “JD.com’s self-operated products” also deceived me."
"Very good, very satisfied. I will buy it again next time. Thank you. Very good. Hahaha"
The battery of the mobile phone does not hold up well. I just bought it and it started to get a little hot after playing for a while. I don’t support buying a mobile phone. Please change it.
"Generally, so, so, so, so, so, so"
"It's pretty good, the screen looks huge. It’s a pity that there is no set or film attached."
It’s okay! Gave it to my mom for watching TV shows. It's just that it's hard to avoid feeling a little sad just because it's bare metal. But I believe in the quality of our Huawei.
Do you support Mengniu or have you changed your taste and chosen another brand?
"After using it for a while, nothing happened. I only charged it once every three or four days while surfing the Internet. There was no lag at all, which is what I want."
There are no exquisite gifts. Negative review
It’s really good for me to play for a while
"Just opened it. The box is very dirty, as if it has been used by someone else. The logistics is quite fast."
satisfy! ! ! ! ! ! !
"When the item was unpacked, there was slime that stained the screen. I hope the merchants will pay attention to this problem when packaging. We are still studying the performance! Will evaluate later!"
"The workmanship is fine, the screen resolution is exquisite, the sound effect is good, the overall running speed is very fast, and there is no lag. I also like the delivery speed of JD.com, which is as fast as ever."
"The machine is okay, but when I placed the order, it came with the original window protective cover, but it was not included. I despised JD.com for deceiving consumers during Double Eleven, and I hope JD.com can reissue it! ! !"
"Well, not bad. At this price, the price/performance ratio is still good."
Express delivery is too slow. Express delivery is too slow. I just got it and haven’t started using it yet.
I bought it for my sister and she said it is very good and I am satisfied with it.
It's okay. There's just a little dust on the inside of the screen. I don't know if it's a bad pixel. It's still good to use.
"I don’t know if the stuff is good or not, but what about the promised gifts? Isn't this a lie? Very angry"
Mengniu brand blue bottle is delicious
"Not very good, very slow."
"It looks pretty, but it runs a little slow! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"Back then, the most popular New Year’s gift in rural markets was milk, and Mengniu and Yili benefited the most."
Why am I so shocked when I look at this child drinking milk? It feels like he is drinking harmful liquid. Mengniu cannot afford to hurt him.
"This phone is indeed a great value for money. The screen is fragile and the inner screen is just like cabbage. It breaks if you hit it. It can’t be repaired. It costs 400 to repair it. Generally speaking, whoever buys it will lose!"
"The products of big brands have stable quality and are very, very beautiful."
"I drank another Mengniu that was on the verge of expiration. . . Sure enough, I had diarrhea again until I was about to die @??? wanted to make an offer"
"The case I just bought yesterday doesn’t close tightly! I moved my hand slightly and thought, is there any return or exchange?"
Mengniu pure milk + Yili original yogurt! Infinitely delicious!
It usually runs out of power after not being used much.
"I don’t want to give it a star. I bought it on Saturday for 1539, and today it’s reduced to 1499. You’re cutting the price too fast. It’s really a scam. I don’t want to give it a star. I will return it when I get home from get off work and try again. purchase!"
"The resolution is low. After three days of use, cracks appeared on the outer frame."
"The color is much better than other brands, but the film in the package is so bad, it looks like a piece is missing when you tear it apart"
"The machine often freezes! Often black screen. Huawei, garbage."
"The Honor mobile phone I use is very good, so I chose this tablet. Honor products are really good and the price is favorable."
It's good for children to play with
"Before I saw the picture, I guessed it, haha, this Mengniu yogurt that filled our classroom with the flavor of red dates was our favorite at the time"
How many millions of people across the country tolerate Mengniu’s poisonous milk? Tolerance or helplessness?
"I have always trusted JD.com, and I like the good stuff!"
"The customer service is so bad. They answer every question when I buy it. After receiving the goods, no one takes care of me anymore. It has been a day and there is still no one! Bad review! If there is a problem, no one will deal with it."
I am used to this large screen and it seems very convenient.
The WIFI performance is very poor and very unstable. I haven’t even seen the promised invoice.
The quality is good. Bought for someone else. No comment for now. Like JD.com’s logistics and services
"The phablet is large and the system is smooth. It doesn't get very hot when playing games, except that it has to be shut down and restarted when changing cards."
"Looking forward to my Deluxe night. . . Thank you Mengniu Niu, hahaha. . . @ Dandan Love travel"
"Pretty bad. The screen cracked after two months. All I can say is, you get what you pay for."
fine. For the elderly. The screen is big and clear.
"The brightness of the screen keeps flickering sometimes, sometimes bright and sometimes dark. What's going on?"
"I bought it at 10:30 last night and it arrived at 11:30 noon. The logistics was very fast. After I picked it up, it was brand new. It is very high-end and smooth to use. It’s good. I like it. In short, it’s very good and cheap!"
"Very easy to use, very clear stream, no lag."
"Bought this for my kids to play with, I heard it’s pretty good!"
"Damn it, my sister is so stuck!"
"Didn’t it say there are 16g? It turned out to be only a little over ten grams. The phone is very stuck. Still relatively slow. I thought this machine was very good! In fact, nothing more than that. Not as good as x1, this machine makes me sad the most. I should have known better than to buy it."
Dad had a great time! ! ! OK OK!
It feels like it is not genuine and the QR code cannot be displayed. I am not satisfied.
"Except for the sound card, which is awkwardly placed at the bottom and the power button on the side, the input is a bit poor, but the rest is trustworthy."
"Very, very dissatisfied, rubbish."
"The customer service was playing a word game here. They agreed to give away this and that, and finally added that they would be given away while supplies last. The result was that it really stopped, and there was no hair. Just say no."
"Garbage, very stuck, poor screen resolution, insensitive touch, you have to press hard, and the click is inaccurate, and the WiFi signal is weak"
"I like to drink pure milk, and I like Mengniu milk. I can drink three or four bottles at a time, and I like to collect the bottles after drinking. Curious weirdness"
"Not bad, the express delivery is very fast and the service attitude is also very good"
"Is it a refurbished product? It has been used for less than two months. Now there is no signal when leaving the county. The network shows 4G, but the phone cannot come in or go out. I really regret it! ! Bad, bad, bad! ! !"
"The tablet was received, but it was packaged normally, without any protective packaging. I am so generous. Is this little thing going to be so lucky in such a cold weather? ! The invoice was not included! ! !"
I don’t drink Mengniu anymore! Problems keep happening! It’s too unsettling for consumers
All functions are very good
Does all liquor have plasticizers? Is it because the current National People's Congress representatives drink too much liquor or Mengniu? Why don't you talk like a normal person? Such people are not in the minority. . It’s really a thousand years of waiting for a fat one. .
Things are very ordinary! But I admit it! Because I know how much money can be spent to get as many things done as possible! But I hope other comrades will not be fooled!
"On the 24th of the Gregorian calendar, Christmas Eve, it was minus five degrees and the cold wind was blowing. I bought a stick of Mengniu Suibian ice cream and ate it alone. This was the most romantic thing I could think of."
The battery of the mobile phone is not durable and cannot be used for a whole day! !
"It’s not very easy to use. There’s something wrong with the touch screen, so I’m too lazy to replace it."
It was delivered at 10 am. It’s good value for money and supports domestic products.
Thanks to Aunt Mengniu @?XY
"Vote with your feet. Grandma, it’s so deceptive. Not only Mengniu, but also deceive others. It’s so deceptive."
"Generally speaking, generally speaking, generally speaking, generally speaking"
"Just two days after buying it, it was reduced by 100 yuan. Today it is 20 yuan cheaper. It has nothing to do with the quality. It is just that the price issue requires a negative review."
"The screen is 8.4 inches and has a 16:9 aspect ratio, making it fully compatible with mobile applications. However, it is a little slender and different from the tablet in my impression. It makes my hands tired when playing Honor of Kings. The sound quality is good and the metal texture is nice."
"Yes, this is good for annual meeting prizes."
The price will be reduced after buying it* I really don’t know how to do it. What a mess. No price bargaining during the National Day event. The price will be reduced after National Day. The pixels are so low. Ai
There is a ball of white light at the edge of the screen. The tablet is actually a large mobile phone. of no use
"Good reviews, this is a good review hidden in a bad review! Don't ask me why!"
"No, the charger doesn't work at all"
"Too bad, too very, very bad, too bad, too bad"
"Thank you Mengniu! More consideration, more love! Double protection."
The screen often freezes and the APP cannot be opened.
The merchandise is very good. Looks good. . .
"Great, 618 was delivered on the same day, really fast. The sound quality of the m3 is unparalleled, with high definition. Affordable price"
"In addition to fraud and plagiarism, does Mengniu do anything else? Your mother is still here."
The quality of the tablet is not good. The screen broke into pieces the day after I bought it.
"Not easy to use, playing with game cards and deceiving consumers"
"The stuff is good, the kids like it, the logistics is fast, I like it"
The card explodes and sometimes fails.
"Well, Huawei's phones are getting better and better now. I bought a 10.1-inch Lanyue a few days ago because the screen is too big to carry around, so I put it at home for my mother to use."
Bought this for my family. They said it runs very smoothly and I like it very much.
"It was said to come with stickers but I didn’t see any, so I rated it poorly."
What rubbish? The screen can’t sense it at all in some places.
"It’s expensive to buy. The price on JD.com keeps changing. When I bought it, it was 1888 and now it’s 1868. Moreover, it’s really not cheap to buy this product at this price. I suggest you keep an eye on it before buying it."
I bought it for a friend. It looks beautiful and the price is not expensive. My friend is very satisfied.
High definition and easy to use. good.
The order I placed before ten o'clock last night arrived this afternoon. It was fast enough. How is the quality? Review after use
It’s a junk phone. I don’t know if it’s a problem with the phone or the supply. The phone can’t be used at all after being turned on. It’s stuck. I really don’t know where I got the junk.
Supports domestically produced products. The price/performance ratio is very good. It is suitable for all kinds of people. Jingdong is trustworthy.
"Pretty good, Huawei is trustworthy!"
It is not easy to use and there is no place to repair it. Now I don’t know why it has been hit by a Trojan horse again. Others can’t repair it. We consumers don’t know where to send it for repair.
"Soar in the air~ Damn it, your brother-in-law is speeding 60% over the speed limit. He will be deducted 6 points and fined 400, and his driver’s license will be revoked? My brain is full of water or it’s expired. I drank too much Mengniu!"
"I’m reviewing it after using it, and I’m looking forward to a great gift."
The machine is good and easy to use! Like it!
"Don't buy it, it's cheap but not good."
"What a crappy phone. After using it for ten days, it couldn't be charged at all. I took it to customer service and told them the opposite. After waiting for another week, customer service still hasn't arrived."
There is no difference between a tablet and a mobile phone. It’s not very fun. It’s just an enlarged mobile phone.
"10-inch is too big, 7-inch is too small, 8-inch is just right, the actual price is 95.8, the picture quality is satisfactory, the use is smooth, the sound effect is ok, I don’t have high requirements, you deserve it, you can have this."
Beautiful and easy to use
"It’s not easy to use. Within half a month, the screen got wet for no apparent reason. Then I couldn’t fix it no matter what I did. I had to pay 300 to 400 yuan for repair. I was the most angry shopping person ever! !"
The item is good and worth buying. The only flaw is that the pin is missing.
"When I received the goods, the box was in a terrible state. The box was very large and there was no lining paper inside, causing the product to vibrate a lot inside. I was worried that the product would have poor contact in the future. I paid too little attention to details, and JD.com's service was not as good as before. Bad review"
I gave it to my mom. The big screen is perfect. I like it very much.
The combination on hand right now is mate9 and m3. The best mobile office combination!
I bought it for someone else and said it works fine!
"I just received it and like it very much, but I didn’t know it was so small. I would have bought a bigger one if I had known."
"After trying it for a few days, I will evaluate it. Other than that, the sound is noisy and lacks clarity."
Items and logistics are okay. It doesn’t even come with headphones or a phone case.
"It's much worse. There are no applications. Even the wireless network is slow. After all, it only has a 4 processor."
I got it at noon today. It’s genuine. I turned it on and played with it for a while. It’s really awesome.
"It’s fast enough, like it in seconds"
"Not bad, I like it very much and support JD.com"
"Very useful, this is the second one, Liding Huawei Honor mobile phone"
A diamond customer is completely disappointed with JD.com and will no longer shop on JD.com in the future.
I told you not to drink Mengniu or eat gutter oil since you were young.
I bought it for my dad. I don’t know what it’s like. That’s it.
"Good, clear picture quality, suitable size! Learn to use enough!"
Mengniu is very honest. . .
Drink warm milk before going to bed. I like Mengniu’s new packaging.
"Logistics is fast, the phone is good"
"Not satisfied, stuck"
It's a very good thing. It's easy to play games. It's easy to use. Overall it's good. It's worth owning.
Good card but touch screen is not sensitive
"I used it for two months, but the result was that I didn’t know what happened, and my old love restarted."
"I just bought a mobile phone and my account was blocked. I couldn’t get anything. The customer service doesn’t even have a black account, what a shameless company."
"The delivery is fast, sometimes it’s a bit stuck, but overall it’s good!"
"Overall, the product is pretty good."
The shame of Mengniu and Yili. A disgrace to the domestic food industry.
I bought it for someone else and there seems to be no problem.
"I will never drink Mengniu again. Who dares to drink? Why is Mengniu still selling? Why are people still buying it? Boycott Mengniu, boycott idiots! This is much more urgent than boycotting Japanese goods!"
Speed ??and enough memory
This is too disgusting! Mengniu! Help! An answer must be given! !
The honest Mengniu is cuter
It is very smooth to use and the picture is very clear. My nephew likes it very much.
"Garbage, refurbished machine, stuck"
"The phone is very bad and automatically jumps. WeChat is not supported, please wait for the software! !"
The delivery speed is very fast and the items are good.
"Domestic high-quality products, good quality and fast, worth owning! ! ! Single card + TF expansion!"
"The quality is really bad, the phone got bent after using it for two months!"
"From now on, I will never buy anything from JD.com, there are so many rubbish and fake products."
Reject Mengniu and never buy Mengniu products again.
A gift for my son? My baby likes it very much. It looks beautiful and is easy to use. I have bought several Huawei phones and they are all very good. They can withstand drops. I believe this one will not disappoint. I will continue to support Huawei and JD.com. .
The tablet is very good and has good battery life. I bought it for my parents and they are very satisfied with it!
"I bought this for my uncle. I don’t use it, but I think he’s very happy."
The conclusion is Weiquan > Mengniu > Yili. The one I bought in Yili is matcha flavored and it tastes terrible.
"There is no difference between the actual product and the picture. I have used it for a while to evaluate it. The game is very smooth. Currently, it seems that I don’t know how to use the split screen and screenshot functions, which brings some inconvenience."
"It's a good product. I've been using it for more than a month and haven't found any problems. I just found out after I bought it that I can't install a mobile phone sim card. Forget it, it's mostly used for watching TV. It's fine just for wireless network."
"Not so good, it automatically restarts while playing! Often."
"I have been using it for a few days and it feels good. There is no problem with the screen and sound quality, but sometimes it feels not sensitive enough. Watching TV and playing ordinary games is enough. There is an invoice."
"It doesn’t come with a film or protective case, it’s dry and the screen resolution is low! Everything else is fine!"
"The screen color is very bad, I don’t recommend buying it. real review"
Great value for money Call+Wifi
"The tablet is easy to use, very thin, easy to hold, has good pixels and no lag"
"The stuff is really good, good-looking and affordable"
Good stuff. Fast delivery. Come to JD.com next time. It’s great.
"Not bad, baby, pretty good"
"Find out whether it is ""negative reports that caused Mengniu's sales to drop by 30%"" or whether it is a quality issue"
"Very smooth, for dad? I'm afraid it won't work smoothly. I played a few games of Honor of Kings without any pressure."
It tastes great! ! ! Yili Meng Niu tastes terrible! ! Three yuan is even worse! Now I only drink Junlebao yogurt! !
Very high pixels! five stars
"Bought for a colleague, very satisfied, good reviews, good reviews, good reviews"
It is indeed a domestically produced product. Huawei's products are the pride of the Chinese people. I don’t know what I think about buying other foreign products. Why isn't such a good thing a top choice?
"It's not bad, but the home button is not very comfortable to use. It's not as troublesome to operate in the background as on mobile phones. Overall, it's good."
"High-end atmosphere, high cost performance, durable battery"
"Not satisfied, the phone is so slow"
"It's not very good, the response speed is a little slow."
Huawei is really powerful. Such a good product is so affordable. I can’t say anything else!
This is my first time shopping on Jingdong Mall. The express delivery is great. The quality is guaranteed. I will come next time.
It's okay. I've been using it for a few days and it's fine for now.
"Good, good, good, good! This price is so good, very satisfied!"
I just opened it and took a look. It is really good. It is worth the money and worth buying. It feels good. I have downloaded a lot of things. It plays smoothly and I can listen to music and watch videos!
Mengniu really makes me feel bad.
I bought it for a friend. He said it runs fast and the screen is big. He likes it.
Sanyuan has been hurt recently. Will Sanyuan be exposed after Mengniu?
"The tablet is very easy to use. I only reviewed it after using it for a while. The clarity is very good, the sound quality is good, and the download speed is also very fast."
There is a shadow on the screen after only one day of use. I don’t know why. .
"I'm sorry, the call version of the telecom card can't be used. Can't you describe it clearly? If you know that the call version can't be used, I won't buy this call version. Can you do things more responsibly? Do I deserve to give you a good review?"
"Not even a leather case or tempered film is included, great job!"
Mengniu’s ice bricks are much more delicious than Yili’s ice bricks. . . .
"Less than a week after purchasing, the product comes with a one-year LeTV membership. There is no way to reissue it or guarantee the price."
"Kaka, I can only say that I am speechless, I don’t know what words to use to describe it."
It's for my dad. It's not bad for a few days.
"A lot of useless software, a waste of memory, the machine is nothing"
Things got even worse after the country annexed Mengniu. Mengniu manager was detained for tampering with product dates (from http:t.cn/zWRsenA
"I bought it last month, but now the browser doesn’t work, I can’t use it at all, I can’t find anything I want to check, and the battery life is very short, I’m not happy, bad review"
"After using it for so long, I can evaluate it. The quality is very good and there have been no problems. A very pleasant shopping experience. Come again next time"
well enough! It feels good to use
"Just after I purchased it, the price was reduced and there were gifts. I felt like I was cheated."
I received the goods without any of the gifts listed above. The merchant has no integrity.
"It's extremely hot. I know you guys won't change it, so I'm not going to change it either."
"There is a speck of dust in the lower right corner of the screen. I originally wanted to exchange it, but it took several days and it was not exchanged."
"Bought for an elderly person at home, fast delivery."
"Nice tablet, smooth, great for watching videos, loud and clear sound. The black border is really big, bigger than expected."
"Changxiang 6, the version is different from what is introduced online. It does not have the ""hold it to the ear"" function, there is no beautification, and the skin beautification effect is worse than ordinary photos. I called the manufacturer's customer service for a day, but the technician did not reply to solve the problem."
"Not bad, worth buying, support domestic production"
"Yili milk is really hard to drink, and Mengniu doesn’t even dare to drink it?"
Logistics is super fast!
"The screen shattered once I dropped it. And the previous price reduction was not real. It was said to be a limited-time price reduction, but it was actually 899."
"Who knows who uses it! Not great! In detail, there are really many shortcomings. Buy carefully! The express delivery is very good!"
"I will never buy anything from Jingdong again, the price will be reduced on the same day after purchase, garbage, and the price difference will not be refunded."
"High cost performance, fast delivery, and good after-sales service. Xin Jingdong is worth recommending."
The packaging was random and got wet from the rain.
"Used it, it’s good, very smooth, and the price is also very cheap, thank you Jingdong"
: Weird~~ You are so awesome. Anyone around you who buys Mengniu again will be scolded as SB!
"The system is smooth and there is no lag, but it’s a bit uncomfortable to look at the big black border?"
Waiting for usage reviews
It's very good. The screen is very delicate and the picture response is very fast. It's just like a big phone. It's very good.
It’s too bad. The battery is weak and the pixels are crap. I don’t know why there are so many good reviews?
It's stuck like crazy. It's not as fast as the old machine from 4 years ago. It's stuck like crazy.
I'm speechless. It turned off automatically after watching the video for three hours! It’s so watery!
"The screen is clear and the sound is really awesome! The system is still smooth. The camera is terrible, but it doesn’t bother me as I don’t use a tablet to take pictures. All in all great value for money!"
A really great tablet.
"It took me a long time to comment, and everything is fine. At first, when the system was not updated, many software could not be used. After the update, there was no problem."
My favorite green mood food turns out to be from Mengniu.
It's good to use. I used to use Apple. I'm still not used to it. It will get better gradually. I hope it can be used for a longer time.
Even the yogurt is damned Mengniu... domineering!
"Not bad, watching movies is much better than using mobile phone."
Don't give too much. The touch screen is not sensitive when used without a film. The system is rigid and the operability is too poor.
It looks pretty and the screen looks good too
Product quality is really bad. It feels like I bought a refreshed machine. Also often crashes. There is not even the most basic protective film on the screen. A disappointing purchase.
It cannot be used before it is used. Turn it on. There is no response when pressing the screen.
Very good. Customer service solves problems quickly.
"The tablet is okay. After all, the price is there, but the courier is so rubbish."
I bought a piece of junk for 2000 and the customer service was not very good and it was awesome.
"My mother thinks this one works better than the other two I bought for her before from other brands, and she is very satisfied."
This is already my second purchase. The quality is okay. My son and I both use Huawei phones. Includes two tablets. Trustworthy.
"Huawei is the Chinese brand. I use Huawei Honor 7 for my mobile phone, and I definitely use Huawei for my tablets. I originally wanted to buy Apple, but after thinking about it, I still support domestic products. It looks very beautiful. I will review it today."
It's very good. I bought one for 1888 yuan before. This time I saw another one and my mother bought one. This will prevent the two elders from competing to play.
"I understand one thing. As humans born with biological and chemical weapons, the Chinese are the best inheritors. So, drink Mengniu and enjoy your genetic pride!"
"The battery is so bad, I gave it one star too much."
"Very good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
Feeling pretty good
"Yes, the quality is very good. I will come again in the future."
"The delivery speed is fast, and the items are okay."
"After using it for several days, I feel pretty good."
I will never drink Mengniu!
Excellent price and good quality
Why did the negative review I just posted disappear? ? ?
"generally,,,,,,,,,,,,"
Why do I want one that can’t make calls? You want to send me one that can make calls?
My favorite drink is Mengniu yogurt. It is natural and harmless and helps digestion. Good babies should drink yogurt regularly.
It hasn’t been a week since I bought the phone. The response is slow and particularly stuck? Can I return it?
It’s a good product for students. The whole family uses Huawei and supports national brands.
"It seems that Mengniu milk tastes better than human milk, which is quite a surprise."
They don’t allow inspection when receiving the goods. The screen is really bad. It’s been a whole day since I applied for a return and no one has come to pick it up.
"You get what you pay for. To be honest, it's quite rubbish. The workmanship is also poor. The buttons are loose and the screen is not sensitive to touch. It's rubbish."
"Bought as a birthday gift for my nephew. It’s not bad, but the price fluctuates a bit."
It's a tablet that feels great in hand and has great sound quality. It's great for children to learn English. Use follow-up comments!
"It's rubbish. It has a video card and poor wireless signal. It freezes when playing games and exiting full screen. I've been using it for a few days and I wanted to make do with it, but I really can't."
"In the past few days, I have always thought it was a problem with the coffee or I didn't brew it properly or grind it enough. Today I just couldn't stand it and made a cup of coffee. Paralysis is Mengniu's problem. It's rubbish. It's just water, not milk."
"To be honest, I like it very much. I gave this to a customer. I gave it to an apple pie before, but I couldn’t copy the files. Since I found this one, it’s high quality, low price, and economical. I like it very much! ! ! I bought several"
"I have been using Honor X1, and now I have upgraded to x2, which supports Huawei and is easy to use."
It's pretty good. I have to say that JD.com's efficiency is really impressive.
"Bought at the event, the price is good value for money"
The black edges of the screen are a failure! Hopefully there will be significant improvements in the future. The resolution of the photo is not very high! Resolutely check reviews on hunger sales! ! !
I’m very unhappy. The price was reduced the day after I bought it. It’s such a scam.
How come such a stupid company doesn't close down? Boycott Mengniu.
"The 949 yuan I bought arrived at three o'clock in the afternoon, but when I boarded JD.com, the phone was 50 yuan cheaper! They told me to apply for price guarantee, and they said the money would arrive in 1-3 days. But after waiting for 4 days, it still didn’t arrive. I don’t know what happened."
The product is great for watching TV. The sound I bought for my brother is very good. I bought it so I can make phone calls.
"Reply Drunk in Changyu, Mengniu reminds you that you will be poisoned if you drink too much"
Mengniu Guanyi milk is good
"Professionally speaking, the resolution of the screen is high enough that the naked eye can no longer distinguish the pixel grid; in addition, no obvious mura, bright spots and other defects can be seen in the picture quality (you have to view it in a low grayscale picture); the hardware is still very good ."
"Mengniu's sweet life photo, my brother is watching silently from the side! Does your family have a partner? Post a beautiful photo of your sister some other day to make your golden retriever brother’s eyes Yonsei, it tastes great."
"Mobile phones are very easy to use, especially for the elderly. The screen is large and the fonts are large. I love it. Five star reviews."
The pixels are low and really crappy. No other problem! ! ! Watching the live broadcast is a bit feverish! Not a big problem
"I bought it for someone, it's said to be very good."
"Big brand, good quality, value for money!"
It's okay if the requirements are not high. It’s the enlarged version for mobile phones. The sound quality is okay. The screen is a bit dark. Big black border.
Overall I actually like it.
"I bought a refurbished phone on September 22, 2016. There were photos from April 2015. The customer service said it was normal."
"The standard configuration of the mobile phone does not even include headphones, which is really weird. I didn’t see what the standard configuration included, and the remarks were unclear."
"For children, there are no headphones, the mobile phone accessories are not ideal, and there is no mobile phone film."
"Reply Mengniu are two words that are indispensable in my life...I will always support you. Hello, thank you for your love for Mengniu products. I am Mengniu’s micro customer service, welcome to follow me."
"Rubbish mobile phone, no WeChat step recording, already thrown away"
"This notebook is very easy to use. I like Huawei. It is thin and light. The sound quality is also good. However, the price dropped a few days after I bought it. I am helpless."
"Not clear, I regret it so much"
The quality is not that good and it broke after a short period of use.
"Very easy to use, I like it very much, but I want to buy the 32G one but I don’t have it anymore."
"No door-to-door delivery, not received, signed for, poor service attitude, private returns, not allowed to open the box for inspection, damaged express packaging, poor express packaging, dirty express packaging, product itself."
"Looks okay, not very easy to use, clear"
Jingdong’s high quality and low price! Good stuff! I won’t be lonely when traveling on business in the future! Support domestic products!
Why does my tablet always have a black screen? I just need to press the power button. What's going on?
"Trash slab. I downloaded a game that was stuck, but when it got stuck, the screen didn't respond when I poked it. On average, Wiff disconnects once a minute, reconnects, and then disconnects. Nothing can be played."
"Very nice, feels good in hand. It's also very thin and doesn't get stuck. I was still deciding whether to buy Apple or Huawei before, and I also used the P9 phone. In order to support domestic products, I finally bought Huawei, and I was not disappointed."
"Shipping is fast, logistics is great! Torn between Apple and this one. After considering it, I still support domestic products and JD.com! It's smooth and very thin. Give it a thumbs up!"
"I was very unhappy with Jingdong and made me angry, so I don’t know how to praise it. . ."
Unknown substance found in Mengniu yogurt! ! ! Very disgusting! ! !
The response was super slow. I regret buying it.
The workmanship is fine and the 2K widescreen performance is exquisite.
I have been paying attention to this Huawei X2 for a long time. I finally bought it this time for 999. I didn’t expect that it also came with an original protective case. I was very surprised. I will take some time to evaluate the usage of the machine.
"The black borders are serious, the actual visible size is 7 inches, the merchant is too disgusting, the special price in late May and the special price in June are gone* I am so disappointed with JD.com! Just take it as a lesson, JD. Bye!"
This is the eighth time I have purchased this water heater. The product is as good as ever and I will come back again.
"The phone's memory was said to be 16G, but it turned out the phone only had 12G! The price dropped a few days after I bought it, and the video playback screen is not clear! A heart is completely dedicated to the delivery person! Just use it! There is no way to retreat..."
"The tablet is still okay, but I really don’t want to talk about the speed of JD.com. The goods shipped from Shanghai have not been delivered to me for three days, and they have no intention of delivering it to me without calling to remind me. JD.com is no longer the original JD.com"
"The packaging is in good condition, the inside is great, the sound quality is okay, and the photos are okay"
"The delivery speed is slow, and some customer service attitudes are poor. They blame each other when encountering problems. I am full of disappointment and lose the desire to buy next time. The only thing worthy of praise is that the complaint over the phone was handled quickly. I can’t remember my work number. Thank you."
"It consumes power very quickly. I can only use it for chatting on WeChat and other things for up to 4 hours. Also, the borders around the buttons on the phone are raised, which is a bummer, but I still like the Huawei brand."
"When I saw this package, I didn't want to say anything. I asked the guard to sign it for me. When I went to pick it up, I saw that the package was in tatters and everything was visible. If someone else walked in, who would be responsible?"
"Yes, the large screen can be used as a PAD and a mobile phone at the same time."
Good value for money
"I don’t want to say anything, just use my phone to look at the pictures. The screen went dark 2 days after receiving the goods, and the battery didn't last a day, so I returned it. The so-called detection refers to something man-made. The 7-day no-reason return policy is just a tactic. Please file a complaint with 315."
The boss’s goods are genuine and well received. Thank you JD.com
"There are really no good choices for Android tablets. I want to buy a cost-effective Xiaomi one, but I can’t. Let’s start with Huawei. It’s been more than half a year since its release and it hasn’t cut the price yet. The overall feeling is that it is a big phone. It’s not bad for children."
"I don’t want to give it even one star. I’ve been using it for a month to review and today it suddenly keeps restarting within a few minutes. If you haven’t bought it yet, I suggest you don’t buy it. I’m not asking for help. I’m really disappointed that I lost a rank in one day."
"One star for the courier, the courier is very good! The tablet gets 0 stars because the camera has fingerprints!"
"After receiving the goods and using it for a period of time, I will comment again. Overall, it is good. The 2g running memory is also OK. There is no use of the card. The appearance is also beautiful. It is pretty good in this price range. The quality will be verified over time..."
"Thinking of supporting domestic production, the result was not satisfactory. Within two months, problems started to appear frequently. I finally couldn’t turn on my phone today! I really want to curse! November 5, 2016!"
"The large screen has a clear picture, which is great for watching TV and playing games."
"Not bad,,,,,,,,,,,,"
"It’s hundreds of dollars more expensive than buying it from the official website. When you open the link, you get a lot of freebies. But you only get a bare machine. Is this the package version?"
"It's not bad. It's for office use. The price is also good when I buy it for events. Overall, it's not bad."
"When taking the photo, it showed that there was a free gift, but after the photo was taken, it was gone. It was very strange. I doubt my integrity."
"The 2k screen is very clear and the performance is good, but the weight is a bit heavy"
"I received the tablet, my baby is so happy..."
"Don't touch the touch screen, it's not good! The resolution is really bad. This is the worst electronic product I have ever bought from Huawei! Can you withdraw?"
"The price dropped just a few days after I bought it, which is quite unreasonable... I'm really speechless. It will get better soon! There is a black dot on the screen."
"Really, I bought a lot of things, but a few days later I was given away a lot of things, which was very unpleasant."
I have been so enthusiastic about applying online recently~ I didn’t even look at the place~ I went to Mengniu~ I just realized that there seems to be no position in Shanghai~ I’ll go there~ Go milking on the prairie~
"Good, good, good"
"JD.com is trustworthy! If there is any problem, please replace it! The courier guy’s service is also great! Nothing to say"
"It mainly depends on your use. For reading, I recommend the 10-inch M2. For entertainment, it is more portable. You can consider the seven-inch youth version. The eight-inch 32-format book is fine, but the 16-inch version is very difficult and cannot be read horizontally."
Good quality and low price. Ordered in the morning and arrived in the afternoon. Like it.
"I unexpectedly discovered that this facial mask is very good. It smells so good, a bit like Mengniu’s mung bean popsicle. It smells very appetizing."
I was so dissatisfied. I looked at the number of the courier guy in Logistics and called 3 times. It was always out of service. I was waiting in a hurry. It was still a Shanxi number. Chatting with the customer service was so cold and cold. He didn’t reply a word. I was blinded. ? ?
Bought two together. Send to a friend. Friends like it very much
Mengniu’s new pillow milk is delicious and shows improvement
I have started to have problems recently. The sound adjustment is not sensitive and the rhythm is about to break.
"It looks good, the picture is clear, and the running speed is okay"
It's okay. I bought it for a friend. I buy all electrical appliances from JD.com. Haven't found any problems yet.
"The size is suitable, the running speed is fast, and the functions are powerful and satisfactory."
"I didn’t like the buffet in the evening, but the late-night snacks were all in my mind. When I got back to the hotel, my colleagues helped me a lot. Although I boycotted Mengniu, I’m really happy~ Are you home yet?"
Mengniu Youyi c original flavor is really delicious
"The screen is very unclear, not even as good as hundreds of mobile phone screens. And since no one was at home during the delivery, the courier threw the package directly through the window. It was thrown five or six meters without fear of breaking it."
It’s great. The after-sales service is great. I don’t know if 122 is expensive.
"Logistics is very slow, it took a month to arrive! The quality is very average, no different from the ones worth more than ten yuan. . . The customer service attitude is also very poor. A very disappointing purchase!"
Very good value for money. Suitable for watching TV
"The screen resolution is too poor, it’s really hard to use, and it’s expensive."
"The quality is quite good, but when I bought it, I asked if I could get a discount. It was not cheap at all, and the price was reduced in just a few hours. I felt very unbalanced."
. . . Outdated stuff. . I regret buying it. . .
"Overall, it is very good. I have always trusted Huawei JD.com and supports domestic products. I started shopping on JD.com!"
"Except for the poor camera, everything else is very good, the response speed is very fast, and the screen is very clear."
Reject Mengniu milk
The screen resolution is so poor that it makes my eyes dizzy. . .
"A fighter jet with a giant screen phone, it’s good and worth buying, but the price has gone up again."
Why doesn't the time automatically update? I feel dizzy. It's still very stuck. I don't feel like it.
The power button doesn’t work
"The screen is exquisite, the workmanship is conscientious, and the standby time is very strong. Anyway, it meets all my requirements for a tablet."
"First time shopping on JD.com, bad experience"
"Not great, not as fast as my mobile phone"
"**! ! ! There was someone else's WeChat account on it, which made my mother unable to log in to her own account! So much needed! Serious contempt!"
"Very poor, very poor. It’s a refurbished machine. It’s still the same after replacing it once. It’s laggy and the Internet is very slow. Bad review, Huawei phones are okay, but stay away from tablets."
The network is so bad that the wireless connection couldn't be connected for a long time. It's really unlucky.
It's okay for use and the standby time is good.
"After using it for a while, I got stuck and the response was slow~ I couldn’t bear it anymore, and I couldn’t quit, so I had to accept my bad luck~"
The packaging is very good. It prompts you to upgrade when you turn it on. You can set it up quickly and start using it. The response is very fast. It’s good and the price is reasonable.
Awesome. The price is not expensive
Bad review! ! ! The screen is not clear. Reading novels is a bit blurry and hurts my glasses.
This tablet is really rubbish. Don’t buy it. Damn it. The after-sales service is rubbish.
"Mengniu drops. . . The taste is mellow, not bad~"
"The pixels are too low, the resolution is too low, how can it be related to high definition? Not satisfied"
Just bought it and haven't used it much yet. But now it feels very good and worth buying
"High quality, good price, Huawei should be praised???!!"
Let the idiots who boycott Japanese goods drink Mengniu Yili and eat gutter oil!
"I don’t know what happened to the machine, it’s still being set up, but the speed of the 16G one before the return was amazing, and the delivery guy’s speed and service attitude were even more impressive; JD.com, you really deserve it...."
I bought it for my mother. It’s pretty good. There’s nothing wrong with it. She’s very happy.
"It is genuine, the speed is very fast, and the store is also very patient!"
"The price of this product purchased at 618 is certainly good. I believe that the quality of Huawei products is very good, and I have been using Huawei products now."
"Yesterday at 22:50, the machine got stuck. I couldn't turn it off even if I turned it off manually. Nothing happened when I clicked on the screen. I don't know how to deal with it now."
It's broken before I use it. There's no menu. What's going on?
Bad review. It broke down just one month and 6 days after I bought it. I can’t charge it. It only shows the charging standard and the plug-in symbol.
I have been using it for a week before reviewing it. It is very useful. It is mainly used for playing games and watching movies. The price is very good value and it supports domestic products.
I placed the order at 22:30 last night and it arrived at 10 am this morning. The logistics is awesome! It’s very comfortable to watch videos in high definition or 720P.
"Damn it, Mengniu has been exposed for quality problems again. I was drinking Mengniu a few days ago, what should I do ???"
"There is no problem with the goods, but the JD courier’s attitude is too bad"
"Huawei Honor tablet quality assurance. JD.com has affordable prices and great logistics, so I give it a five-point rating!"
"This is my first time buying a Huawei product. I don’t know how it is, but it’s really cheap."
"The connector in the lower right corner is loose. I pinched it with my hand and thought, the workmanship is average."
"I hope JD.com can give an explanation. Is it a 3G system? 16G memory storage? There is only 10GB of storage in total, and there are pictures and facts. I hope JD.com will compensate for my losses. (memory card) and the display is very blurry and dark"
"This thing doesn't work, the back cover is too loose"
"Jingdong Express is really fast. I received the machine better than expected. After all, it is only a thousand yuan machine. Except for the poor resolution and average running speed, everything else is fine."
"There is Mengniu in front of us, and there is light again!"
"Wow, I received the long-awaited tablet today. The stereo sound effect is great, the screen is clear and the size is just right. I like it very much! Thank you store! Hurry up and stock up, there are still friends who want to buy!"
"Huawei tablet is really good, the signal is good and the impact is good"
"It's super cool, much better than the Samsung I used before."
"The speed is quite fast, the response is sensitive, and the sound quality is good. I hope to continue our cooperation next time. There shouldn't be a big advantage in terms of price."
"The quality is very good, the appearance is beautiful, and the logistics is satisfactory."
"7 Tsai, fried noodles, Mengniu Youyi C. My favorite, haha!"
The product is not great! !
"The screen aspect ratio is different from the iPad. This one is more like an enlarged version of a mobile phone. It is mainly for children, and the performance should be okay!"
"Damn, the screensaver is wrong. It’s completely wrong, okay? Is it a lie?"
The two-yuan breakfast at school is really rich. . . . Mengniu boxed milk. . porridge. . Rice pudding. . Small noodles. . steamed stuffed bun. . Steamed bun. . Still very comfortable. . .
Pixels are too low. Not clear. Not as good as expected
"good! There is nothing wrong with you, all your faults are others! Representative of the Herds Party: There is nothing wrong with Mengniu Yili, the problem lies at the source http:t.cn/zjzbDrY (Shared from @??)"
The speed of logistics is nothing to say. I got it in less than 24 hours. It looks very good. You won’t know the quality until you use it. I feel pretty good.
"Warwick, the pride of China, great, the quality is so great, better than Apple"
"Very good, but the card slot 1 is not easy to remove. If there is no problem with the machine, I won’t change it. After all, I don’t change cards very often!"
Chinese consumers’ confidence in Mengniu cannot be destroyed
"I bought it for my family, and I’m satisfied with it so far."
The water heater works great.
Huawei's product is quite cost-effective. I don't want to play games or watch videos. The speakers are good. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
"Personally, I feel that the price/performance ratio is not high. I was sleeping, so I called the customer service for an interview. I was buying it for my colleague, so I told her the truth, but the customer service hung up without saying a word."
"The progress of domestic mobile phones in the past two years is obvious to all, especially Huawei has put a lot of effort into the terminal area. It is not a dream to continue to work hard to catch up with the United States, Britain, Japan and Europe!"
"Just use it, it's a bit long and not wide enough."
"Not bad, mom likes it very much"
The tablet is good. It has a beautiful appearance and a suitable size. The screen resolution is clear and the running speed is also good. I have always used Apple. Now it supports domestic products and the event price is good!
"Share the case of Mengniu’s “Exercise + Guanyi Milk Health Dual Guarantee”. Regular exercise + Guanyi Milk, double immunity protection during seasonal changes! ]Wow~International friends also like to drink it"
The packaging is so disgusting and makes people feel uncomfortable!
"Parallel imported mobile phone, top-notch mobile phone, no mobile phone signal every day, I used it too fast, I don’t buy mobile phone on JD anymore, fake, fake"
"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who drink milk and those who don't. I want to turn these two kinds of people into one kind of person, that is, everyone drinks milk. To borrow a sentence from Mengniu: Just for a little bit of happiness."
"It is a very good tablet. It can play games without lag, watch movies and TV shows with clear picture quality, and take photos with natural and non-distorted pictures no matter day or night. Huawei is really good."
The invoice is poorly packaged
The existence of Mengniu and JD.com is too reasonable
"Other functions are fine, but recently when I use the flashlight on my phone, it freezes. It freezes after about 30 seconds of turning on the flashlight. Is there any way to solve it?"
"If anyone of you buys it, just wait until you regret it. I’ll go cry first!"
We must show our determination to boycott Japanese products to boycott Mengniu. Adults should not drink milk.
"Super cool, smooth, oh my, I just really, really, really like it."
"Look clearly, if you buy Mengniu ice cream, it comes with screws... it’s so scary!"
"It’s so disappointing. After upgrading the system to a new one, the screen keeps going black. Even when playing games, the screen goes black."
"The M3 tablet has good value for money, but the accessories lack headphones!"
I have been using it for two months and it is good. It is very good for my children to learn.
"good! Good tablet! JD Express is even better! JD.com, save more, faster and more!"
"Bad review, damn, they don’t even have headphones and they don’t give me anything. Bad review"
Is there anything else I can drink? A Mengniu manager was caught tampering with the production date
Yes. not bad. fine
"The logistics is very fast, and I like it very much when I receive it. It seems that the response is a little slow, not as fast as the iPad."
My son’s birthday gift. I like Huawei and support Huawei. My son likes it very much.
High cost performance and suitable for children to study
"When I got it and opened the packaging box, I saw that the phone was damaged and it would be troublesome to exchange it. I was really depressed!"
"For general use, the resolution is too low"
"It's very good, the speed is very fast, and it looks good. The logistics is very fast. I placed the order in the morning and arrived in the afternoon."
It’s just a bigger mobile phone. Don’t buy it.
"I bought it for someone else. I don’t know what it is like, but I always support Huawei. I’d like to give you a good review first."
"I have been using it for a day and it feels good. The best thing is the speed of express delivery. If you place an order at night, it will arrive in the morning."
"Mengniu loves to be clean. Garfield, you could use a little more eye droppings."
"Huawei tablet supports domestic products. If you are patriotic, you must support domestic products. The sound quality is good. Huawei is really good now."
"The effect is very good, the screen is colorful and the size is suitable for playing in bed and watching videos. It's not bad for playing games, but it's a bit tiring and not comfortable without a mobile phone. The battery lasts a long time."
"There is no invoice, and the button response is not sensitive. It takes a few times to press the return button before it responds."
"It is used in the same way as Huawei mobile phones. It is used for my husband’s office. It is very suitable for looking at excel sheets. It is convenient to hold during meetings. I have not complained about it after using it for so long. There are also two speakers, which are good for listening to music."
"Taken on Double 11, 999 is really worth it, but it will really get hot after playing for a long time. Watching TV and watching pictures is fun. The 4G signal is very good, and the Internet speed is faster than wifi. Even indoors, the signal is very good, which is good."
This is the second one I bought. I believe it is worth the money. I trust JD.com.
"Christmas Diary 4: Mengniu’s new 340mL yogurt tastes great. The newly bought cups and spoons are all red, so that drinking water feels like drinking blood. . . In summary, the life of a foodie is finished."
Not bad not bad not bad not bad
"I took a picture of Expad for my son. It has been a while since I received it. I feel pretty good so far. The logistics is very fast. Overall, it feels okay. Good reviews!"
"Huawei is very good, but after updating the system, there is no error of not being able to connect to the network."
Nice phone tablet
"It supports domestic products, the size is good, the screen is very clear, the sound quality is very good, and the operation is very smooth. I checked it and it is genuine. Since I just started using it, the standby time remains to be seen. I am very satisfied!"
"I just arrived today and spent the entire afternoon. The screen clarity is very poor, the speed is average, and the power consumption is average."
What kind of garbage is this? I can’t even write it clearly. I can’t install a number card when I buy it. Is there any use for it?
"Mengniu tampered with the production date, Harbin Bridge collapsed, how sad"
"Very good, much easier to use than Apple, supports domestic products, especially the sound quality is great and the picture quality is super detailed and good???"
"The body is pretty good, no issues. However, there is a bit of a lag in playing King of Kings. After all, the price is what it should be."
A very unpleasant shopping
I just started using it today and it looks pretty good. I’ve been using it for a while.
"Others said that the second-hand dealer never paid attention to it, but this time it really happened to me. The phone's packaging had been opened and there was still dust on the screen."
The phone is so rubbish. It’s the first time I’ve used such a crappy phone.
"There are no needles, and I don’t know how to insert a mobile phone card. I guess I have to go to a mobile phone store and ask someone to get it removed, which is really frustrating."
deceive consumers
"Already activated. Either returned or refurbished. It's hot. Note that it's not hot, it's hot. No headphones, no need to explain, there were quality issues when buying things on JD.com three times in a row. I will never use JD again. ."
"I didn’t even have headphones, just a bare mobile phone. I thought at least it would have a mobile phone screen protector, but I was still disappointed."
Mengniu and Yili are shameless! More and more shameless! resist! Resist firmly! ! !
"Reduced* just after buying it, why should it be such a scam?"
"There is a problem with the touch screen. If you press and drag the screen icon for a while, it will malfunction. When playing Honor of Kings, the direction control wheel will malfunction after a while."
Does this tablet have any rivals for its configuration? Worth having. . . . . . . .
I am very satisfied with JD.com's logistics. The tablet system worked well before the upgrade. The price/performance ratio is indeed high.
"Bad review, no headphones shipped, I contacted customer service the day before yesterday, but no one has responded to me till today,"
This is my first time using a Huawei phone. It’s not as good as I imagined. It gets very hot after using it for a while.
I bought it for my relatives. I think it works very well. They like it very much and the price is right.
"He has stopped drinking or buying Mengniu for a long time, and the rogue enterprise will let him perish! !"
It’s Mengniu’s garbage again!
"Anyone who says it’s not stuck is just trying it out for myself. Many functions don’t have double-click to wake up the screen. Wait, it’s stuck again, hey! Fooled"
"Not for personal use, the size should be fine"
"Very satisfied with a purchase, the service is in place and the problem is solved in a timely manner, 5 stars"
The configuration is okay and you get what you pay for. The battery is a bit small and the battery life is a bit short. Five-star praise!
"The sound quality of the tablet is very good, the response is very smooth, and the video is very clear."
"I've been playing with it for a few days after it arrived, and it's a bit laggy when playing King of Kings, but everything else is fine. I don’t know if it can be replaced"
"Good, good, good, good, good, good"
I just received the product and downloaded Honor of Kings to play. The screen quality and resolution are very poor. The sound of playing games is so hoarse. Want to return but find it troublesome
"The book is very good, the screen is only a little smaller than the iPad mini, and the touch screen response is smooth, just like the iPhone or iPad. It’s great to watch the show!"
I didn’t receive all the gifts. I’m really upset. The machine is fine for the time being.
"Didn’t you say you’d give me the film, liar?"
"Yes, it is suitable for use."
That's it. He said he had an invoice but didn't give it to me. He lied to me again and couldn't tell me. I was too lazy to look for it.
"I don’t know what to say, but things just don’t work. When I open the settings, the screen is black, stuck, and can’t be used. I’m speechless. I’m very disappointed."
"The speed is very fast, but the body is too soft and bends easily, but it can be straightened."
"If Mengniu doesn’t die, we will die. Mengniu: Mengniu, I am not good at it; Mengren, I am very good at it!"
"The quality is so-so, the network speed is too slow, laggy"
Keep upgrading the system after booting. . . . . . The configuration is quite good and supports domestic products.
"The resolution is not high, so I regret buying this. I heard that Xiaomi’s quality is better at this price."
I bought it for a colleague. The first one broke. This is the second time I bought it back. The quality is still acceptable. The price is 200 yuan cheaper than the first time. It seems that the price of this electronic product is going down very quickly.
"I regret so much. I took a photo in this store and the price was immediately reduced within two hours after the photo was taken. If I had taken the photo two hours later, I could have saved the price by 200 yuan."
It's a pity that I can't use the telecommunications card
#??#The cow is so pitiful
"Mengniu Yili probably wrote it,,, nonsense."
"Huawei tablet, the price is ok, it works well, the battery life is average, that’s all."
"Bought from Jingdong offline experience store, very good!"
Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu! When will Mengniu prepare to apologize?
Logistics is great! Received it the next day! Well packaged! The service attitude is very good! Satisfied! Always trust Jingdong Mall! Always support Jingdong!
"I bought it a few days ago on 618, ** and they won’t refund the price difference, bad review."
"very good! A very satisfying purchase. Logistics is also very fast. Full five points. I hope the manufacturer can give me some gifts. Such as leather cases, headphones, etc."
"I didn’t bring any gifts, and the packaging was very crude."
"I sent it over and it looks pretty good, but I haven’t used it yet."
"I like to drink Mengniu kefir, haha"
"No lag, everything is fine"
I have received the phone. I like it very much. The screen is big and can be used for basically everything. I hope it can be used for a long time. Good review.
Rubbish Mengniu! ! ! !
"Really good guy, Huawei quality, I hope this tablet can make me worry-free and continue to pay attention to Huawei products. I've been using it for two days now and haven't found any defects yet. The sound is good."
"The old man used it to watch TV series, and it ran smoothly. The first one shipped was defective, and the merchant quickly replaced it! ?"
The plan I bought for my company is good and very useful.
"Personally, I like Mengniu’s new packaging better."
"After using it for a few days, the battery is durable, the system is smooth, the resolution is fine and clear, and the price is high."
Very useful and clear
"Bad review, anyway, a very unpleasant purchase. Don't worry, it affects your mood. It's a big deal. Bad reviews, bad reviews."
I can't play skills when playing Honor of Kings Mobile. The customer service told me that it's a problem with the third-party software. It still freezes when I play Xiaoxiaole. I bought this just to play games. I can't even play games. What's the use of buying this?
"Very thin, the screen display effect is relatively clear, overall I am very satisfied, the delivery is still very fast as always, very good, full marks"
"It doesn’t matter what you say, anyway, I don’t drink northern room temperature milk. There is nothing wrong with Mengniu Yili, so the only ones who had problems before were the consumers."
"It's okay to use this, I just want to ask why it defaults to Thai when booting, but it crashed at that time! Just relying on my knowledge, I think it’s a refurbished or factory-returned machine, and it’s ready to use once it’s turned on. I’ll really have to think about it when buying from JD.com in the future."
Super easy to use. I like it very much.
I hope Mengniu’s poisonous milk will not poison other people’s brands.
"The system is slow, not as good as note4x"
"The resolution is extremely low. If you consider the price, feel free to take a leave of absence."
"Back from shopping at Carrefour~ The refrigerator is full and my pockets are empty. . . Mengniu red date yoghurt is so affordable, I will bring it to my mother next time I go home ~ In comparison, the prices in Basuo are really higho(???)o"
"The price dropped as soon as I bought it, and the original set was given as a gift. How can I be so sad?"
"If the invoice is issued in error, it will not be changed. This is too overbearing. Everyone should pay attention in the future."
Smearing is severe and the game is stuck.
Very cost-effective and beautiful
Very good. I bought an N8 mobile phone before and now I have bought an M3. Huawei has never disappointed me. Thank you.
I bought it as a birthday gift for my mother-in-law. It is enough for watching news and videos for the elderly. JD.com has great logistics and has a five-star rating!
The phone is well made and runs smoothly!
"It’s not fun, I can’t play Asphalt 8. It’s awkward to view pictures without the automatic rotation function. Watching movies is not very clear either."
"Good quality and low price, worth buying... I bought a lot of them"
"Logistics turtle, too slow."
"I must leave a negative review, TAT! The price was reduced** three days after I bought it. I felt so unbalanced. The delivery was so slow. They even asked me to go out on a bicycle for a wasted trip. I couldn’t explain it clearly. TAT"
"Jingdong blocked the account for no reason, and kept arguing every day, dragging its feet and not responding! Please support me so that more people can see JD.com’s face clearly! ! !"
The campus simulation sales competition run by Mengniu has achieved good results. It has made a lot of money and made big profits with a small investment. This is considered a good marketing strategy.
The photo is very clear.
I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it. The response is fast and the sound quality is good. It's great for watching movies and listening to music!
"For breakfast today, Mengniu Xinyangdao donkey-hide gelatin and red dates were good, very fragrant."
It turns out that this time the men's basketball team is sponsored by Mengniu.
"I will never use Mengniu products, and tell others that Mengniu is a garbage company. I will not take orders from Mengniu, read Mengniu advertisements, or buy newspapers with Mengniu advertisements."
"Overall, it's pretty good. I'm very satisfied after seeing the machine."
My favorite Mengniu is in stock again.... Do you want to drag a few bottles to the car during the Spring Festival~~~
"The phone can't answer calls and hangs up, it's a complete mess!"
"Fool consumers. Yesterday I received a free gift when I placed an order, but today I saw nothing! Also playing football, how can this be possible!"
"I gave it to my mother to watch TV. When I received it, it was well packaged and the screen was a bit dizzy. It’s very good for a product worth 1,000 yuan. I’m very satisfied."
"Quick, it makes people feel comfortable! Good review!"
You have to have a bit of professionalism when it comes to counterfeiting. Mengniu and Yili will never buy it.
"Anthracene, the baby is very cute, but why do you hate Mengniu? This is Bai Tianzhao! At 100 days, it will be about 16 or 7 pounds. Now I'm 19 pounds."
"Hahahahahahahaha, okay, okay, okay"
"Director, just click on it and dream of Mengniu! I believe in bull"
It’s not easy to use. I’m unhappy to death.
It’s not bad. There are too few accessories and no refund. The film itself is very dirty.
"The battery drains very quickly; the back of the tablet becomes very hot after being used for a long time; the Android system is very difficult to use, and the user experience is far worse than iOS. The first and last Android tablet."
"Something given to an old man, he likes it very much!"
The sound of the call on the mobile phone is very quiet. I can't hear clearly even if the call volume is turned up to the maximum. Why can this kind of mobile phone pass the test?
"The tablet is very good, videos can be viewed clearly and without lag, and the sound effects are also very good. I just don’t know what the battery life is like, this will take time to verify!"
"The screen broke within a few days of buying it, and I regretted that it was not covered by warranty."
"The one I bought has 4GRAM and 32GROM. Although the memory is smaller, the running memory is larger, the gaming experience is better, and the Wifi function is also relatively powerful. I always feel that the screen is a bit small. It's quite comfortable to use otherwise."
"It is an Android system, so you cannot download Windows software or reinstall the system. Unfortunately, when you return the product, you have to pay extra because the invoice is lost, which is very sad."
"Not bad, that’s the price!"
"Things are good, the system is smooth, movies can be watched clearly, and the sound effect is good. The only drawback is that the charging port is not type-c."
"After I bought it and used it for a week, it crashed. The authorized repair station inspected it and said that the monitor and cables were broken. I felt dizzy."
It’s really good to use. It’s late to review. I support Huawei and JD.com.
"The tablet looks pretty good, and the customer service is also very good. The film that comes in the box is terrible. There is a slight flaw in the charging interface of the tablet, and the machine does consume a bit of power."
Watching movies is stuck and speechless
"The stuff is good, I bought it for my elders"
The Huawei App Store on this tablet cannot automatically install apps. I have bought 5 Huawei phones. This is the first time I have encountered such a poor ROM before shipping.
"The phone is a bit bent as a whole, and the customer service service is rubbish. I have been waiting for two days and there is still no reply. I hope friends who buy it in the future will be careful! Strongly request return! Rubbish mobile phones are not as good as those in physical stores."
ok
"To put it simply, the left and right borders are relatively narrow, and the body is thin and light, making it easy to carry. Internet speed is relatively fast."
Didi’s good quality makes Mengniu milk accompany you healthily and happily every day.
"Good, good, good, good, good"
"The express delivery was a bit slow, and when it arrived, the tape on the package had come loose (you could see the contents inside), but fortunately the contents inside were not damaged."
"Very good, but the memory is a bit small, other things are okay"
Looking forward to seeing Mengniu! Are they all brands we are familiar with before? !
Much better than I expected. Like it very much. Watch TV online.
The screen effect is too poor.
I don’t want to say anything about what I bought on the 10th. I just got it now at 23. Things are also stuck. It’s not easy to use and the tablet is ugly.
Not bad~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Huawei is trustworthy, but the price is cut too fast, and it’s 300 cheaper"
"Bad review, the available memory is less than 10g, I am too lazy to return it."
"I just found out today that Deluxe belongs to Mengniu. It’s embarrassing, it’s embarrassing."
"In my day, ban it. Mengniu and Yili have done enough public relations. I won’t buy Mengniu and Yili."
"The phone is so-so. The most annoying thing is that when I buy a mobile phone, it doesn’t come with headphones. Really, it doesn’t come with anything. Others come with so many things. I won’t buy these on JD.com in the future. The prices are the same."
It’s my first time using Huawei. I feel pretty good. I’m very satisfied with the experience. I just got it today and I’m trying it out. It’s a very high-end model.
"What about Mengniu? Is this considered a heavy penalty? Too expensive, can't afford to wear it"
"When I bought it, it showed that there were gifts, but after I received the goods, there were no gifts. Moreover, the delivery speed was also slow. I had to wait for 3 days before it was shipped. If it hadn't been for the reminder, I probably wouldn't have known when it would be shipped."
The buyer's impression is that the color is good-looking and the workmanship is fine. It is cheaper than the official website and has no color difference. It is original and authentic.
I am very pleased that the banana + organic raw milk imported from Brazil is of course delicious. Tasteful! ! Mengniu is a very good dairy company. Peng Xiao: Thank you for supporting Mengniu products!
"Today’s dinner is Mengniu oatmeal yellow peach kefir, which is delicious... Mengniu"
The computer is very good and the logistics is fast.
"Junk resolution, buyer beware. The resolution of domestic mobile phones is no better than that of 5 years ago!"
"I was surprised to find that it turned out that the drinks our school gave to the children were Mengniu. Sin, sin!"
Mengniu has changed its packaging. This packaging is quite funny. Is it trying to tell us that cows eat grass and milk them?
"The film that was sent was not attached, which is funny. After receiving the goods, overall, I feel good, the size is quite suitable, and it works normally when turned on. It is just that there is no wireless connection now. I will wait to connect it again to see the effect! !"
It was hundreds of dollars cheaper when I bought it. Hold
"Although it is made by Mengniu, it tastes really good, just like the previous cocoa milk."
"I bought three Huawei phones, and this one is the worst. The previous battery lasted for two or three days, but this time it didn’t even last a day. I suspect it was returned by someone else. Bad review"
"It’s been a long time since I sent it, so it’s good. Support Huawei"
"Watching TV series on a mobile phone using WIFI is not as smooth as my unknown brand mobile phone, special!!!"
I feel a bit cheated. Quad-core 2g running 16g memory beggar version.
"The overall feeling is good when I get it. The screen has an atmospheric and clean feeling, and it is quite smooth to use!"
"good. . . Bought for the elderly at home, I like it"
I bought it during the Qingming Festival and it arrived on the same day. It took me so long to evaluate it. It was very useful and I made another successful purchase.
"How can I put it, this price is already good. The battery life is really great."
"It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s really good, it’s genuine."
It’s just a big mobile phone. It’s beautiful. I bought it for my wife. She likes it very much.
"It takes a long time to charge, and it ran out of power within less than 2 hours after being fully charged. The price was reduced within 15 days of purchase and no returns are allowed."
"It's great to use, no smearing at all. Sometimes the desktop will freeze, but it does not affect the use. After all, it is a 950, not comparable to the 820."
Boycott Mengniu! !
"It's over, it's over, the garbage Mengniu Yili is coming to bully our Yantangxiangmanlou. I want to take out a loan and raise cows. Repost on Weibo."
"Good size. Beautiful style. Ordered in the morning and it was delivered in the afternoon, very fast. It is for my mother to watch TV, the camera is not high definition. Relatively vague."
"Good, timely delivery"
"Yogurt is just yogurt, but also growing milk? ! The Ai family was deceived again. # Mengniu cheating#"
"JD Express is very fast, the tablet is easy to use, economical and affordable"
"The price is reduced after only one day of purchase*, which is so cheating, and there are no gifts!"
"If you want to boycott Japanese goods, boycott Mengniu first. . ."
"Junk delivery. . It only took 3 days to arrive. My address is only a few hundred meters away from your service point. It didn't deliver the goods. It's rubbish. Bad review. . . Atmosphere, bad reviews, bad reviews"
It's okay. It was too expensive. The price was reduced the next day. I applied to make up for the difference and the money was refunded smoothly.
"I bought it for someone else. I don’t know how it will be used, but it should be fine. I support domestic products."
The baby looks pretty good. I haven’t used it yet. It’s not as big as I thought. I’ll comment after using it.
1. The so-called intelligent learning is stealing privacy. 2. Force automatic version upgrade in the background.
"I was on vacation on the 30th. It was really hard. I was also on vacation during those days, thank you to Mengniu for the hard work. The Mengniu milk was produced on February 30. Mengniu has worked hard, and COFCO has worked hard! It's hard work"
"Does this taste like? Not like that. Well, I hate Mengniu the most!"
Mengniu has no bottom line in its evil deeds
Not ideal
The delivery was sent to another place for me. It's so irresponsible. You're messing around.
"The customer service is poor. I bought the machine and used it for two days. If I have any questions, the customer service is dumb."
"It's smaller than expected, but it's okay. I paid extra for freight, but it was delivered half an hour earlier than the scheduled time. Fortunately, I arrived home just in time and it was not on time at all."
faint! Mengniu high-end products! boycott mengniu boycott boycott
"I have always wanted to say something that I dare not say for fear of offending my friends: after many years of experience, Mengniu tastes better than Yili, and the effect is better. I can speak honestly."
"I bought two units, but one of them has a screen that is unresponsive and cannot be turned on and off normally. If you apply for repair, you have to mail it to me and pay the shipping fee! Not to mention the poor quality, it’s so inconvenient! Bad review!"
"Very good, Huawei will try it first"
"The machine jammed just one day after purchase, and the promised tempered film was not given. I was very disappointed."
"Bought for LP, she likes it very much. Buy this 32G one, and then buy a 128G TF card to solve the problem of insufficient storage and save some money."
"Bad review: Every time I charge it, it either fails to charge or crashes."
"It is a very average product. The screen often goes black. It is set to go to sleep after 5 minutes, and often goes to sleep in less than 10 seconds. It is very painful to use. There is no return button. Sometimes after a screen is opened, it cannot be exited, which is very annoying."
"No, this version is not good. The resolution is low, making it uncomfortable to watch."
"The service attitude is not good, they promised to give me a 16G memory card. The result was not delivered. Asked customer service and asked for feedback! ! There is no news from the end of 2015 until now! !"
"It works very well, and there are no problems so far."
The price is pretty good! It’s just that the theme cannot be downloaded like other products.
It is for the elderly. It is very beautiful and has excellent sound quality. The elderly like it very much.
"The Chinese people are so bullshit and don’t boycott Mengniu and other rubbish, Japanese products, their brains are filled with water."
"It's like an enlarged version of a mobile phone. The screen is good, the sound is good, and the configuration is completely sufficient. I bought it for an event. It was dozens of yuan cheaper. The high-definition screen sticker came with it, but it doesn't feel very good in the hand."
"After just one day of use, a green line appeared in the middle of the screen. It must be that the screen is broken! You support domestic products so much, yet you treat me like this! It’s the end of the day?"
"Quite satisfied with it, the configuration is high, the screen is clear, and the menu keys are powerful, unexpected! JD.com delivered the product in a timely manner. I started using it immediately and haven’t found any problems yet."
Fast logistics! Very satisfied with the tablet! The battery is also relatively durable! Support domestic products! ! ! !
Why didn't you give me an invoice?
"Playing King is a bit stuck! It’s a new phone, but it’s stuck! It's better to use Xiaoqi for more than half a year. Most importantly, where are the invoices? Did you eat it secretly? I didn’t give you a rice cooker last time I bought it, but I didn’t give it to you this time! ?"
"Grassroots officials in Inner Mongolia: There is nothing wrong with Mengniu and Yili, but the source is unsafe http:t.cn/zjzckIt (Shared from @Sina Finance)"
"No, the wlan signal is intermittent!"
"It’s pretty good. The battery can last for five or six hours when playing Honor of Kings. It should last about seven or eight hours when playing other games. It gets a little hot when playing games, but everything else is fine. Also, the price is a bit expensive."
"Liar, I placed an order on September 9th and the price was reduced on September 12th."
"The baby has been used very well. The installer Fu came to the door the next day after receiving the call and installed it. He has a good attitude, the quality of Midea is good, and the service quality is also good,??"
"The one sent to the mobile phone is not new, it’s too bad."
"I only bought it a month ago, and now there is no sound when I answer the phone... super depressing."
"Big means big, awesome and leveraged"
"Not so good, the screen has three white dots. I'd rather buy Apple."
"fail! I shouldn’t buy cheese from Mengniu! My chicken mashed potatoes recipe was a fail! I used the wrong ingredients, but the only good thing is that the mashed potatoes are delicious."
"It can be used as both a tablet and a mobile phone. It has fast touch speed, smooth system, and clear screen. This is the second time I bought a Huawei tablet. Trustworthy."
The screen is too inferior. There are mosaics everywhere. It makes my eyes dazzled after looking at it for a while. Huawei is such a big brand but produces such rubbish products. I am really speechless. This is the last time I use Huawei.
"I received the tablet, it is very good, the sound is loud, the screen is clear, and the speed is very fast. AnTuTu scored 90,000 points. It is good for playing games and watching movies. Honor of Kings is very powerful! The whole process is 30 frames without losing any frames!"
"I've been using it for a while and haven't found any problems. It's still good, but it doesn't support telecommunications cards."
I don’t want to say anything. I can’t touch the screen more than three months after I bought it. I was told that there is no outlet nearby to send it for repair or something. I was deceived. I will kill you this time and I won’t buy a domestic product next time. I don’t want to say anything.
"The quality is pretty good, I haven’t started using it yet, I hope it lasts a long time"
"No invoice! How can electronic products not have an invoice? If there is a quality problem, who should I go to? ! urgent! urgent! urgent! Jingdong: Aren’t you awake yet? ?"
"I just received it today, well, the quality is okay, the logistics speed is very fast, very fast, I am using it, I will evaluate it after using it, it is very good!"
Maybe it’s because I’m used to Apple. I can't give you a good review. Slow startup and slow response.
"Mom said it was good. In 20 years of online shopping, this is the first time that online shopping has been delivered to the village by express delivery. Although it was not delivered to my home. Having your own logistics is awesome! This is incomparable to three links and one link."
"There was nothing given when I purchased it, but it was updated to something was given just after I received it. You can only consider yourself unlucky!"
"M3 Youth Edition seems to be Qualcomm Xiaolong 435, right? ? A little feverish,"
"Ever since I found out that my favorite milk is from Mengniu, I have given up on myself."
"The stuff is very good, I like it very much~"
"Everything else is satisfactory. However, the volume is too low. I can’t hear the WeChat chat voice. The resolution is low and the screen is dazzling. The main reason for returning the product is that the volume is too low. I have returned the product and bought a new Dashen S1 to see how it goes."
"I originally bought it to take photos of IDs, but my colleagues said it couldn't autofocus, so it was like buying it for nothing. The product reviews said it could, but it didn't actually work, which was frustrating."
"Bought it for three nines, very cost-effective!"
"The tablet is pretty good, I bought it just for its battery life."
"Support domestic products, support Huawei!"
"Yuan Wenshi Vincy: Reply: Really responsible. Hello, thank you for your support of Mengniu. We will continue to work hard."
"Very good, I like it very much, the sound quality of the product is great"
"It's okay to use, I got used to it just by looking at the black edges."
"If I could not give it even one star, I wouldn't give it. Even if you don't use your phone, it will automatically shut down after one day when the phone is fully charged! ! !"
Rubbish stuff is too stuck
Both mobile phones and tablets are from Huawei and support domestic products.
"I also think that Mengniu should not make such a low-level mistake. It should be a fake call to the police. Marketing Weibo, be careful!"
"The screen is yellow and the film has already been applied, so I’m too lazy to replace it."
"Regardless of quality issues or not, Mengniu is currently very unlucky."
The back is uneven. Uneven. . . . .
I really don’t want to give a good review
The product quality is very good and the delivery is timely.
Foodies in Mengniu Industrial Park
I bought it for my dad. I'm very happy. The quality is good.
The commercial Mengniu shot this time is good and people-oriented. Very warm.
"The screen size is appropriate and the system is smooth. The camera isn't very clear, but I don't take many photos with a tablet. It’s a bit bad to apply a screen protector yourself, after all, not many people know how to apply it."
I used #?checkQR code to compare prices# and found out that the Mengniu Baili Bao Red Date Yogurt 180g I bought was cheap.
I bought it for my sister. It's OK. It's OK for watching TV and playing small games. The charging time is too slow and the sound is low. Everything else is fine.
I have been using it for a while and it is very good. My girlfriend likes it very much!
The Huawei brand is trustworthy and recommended.
It’s different from the last time. The quality this time is not good.
Very good. My children always grab my phone and I buy it for them to play with. I placed the order at four or five o'clock in the morning and it arrived at four or five o'clock in the afternoon. The courier guy is very good and delivered it downstairs on a hot day. Thank you for your hard work. .
"I really like drinking Mengniu milk, it’s vanilla flavor~"
"Moreover, after one of the three was repaired, after receiving the repaired machine and turning it on, it was found that the touch was still malfunctioning. This kind of repair cannot be given a single point."
"The screen is very clear and the operation is OK, but sometimes I can’t connect to the Internet. The size is just right and it’s comfortable to hold. I think Huawei is a good brand."
Got a gift? Fooling people?
"It's so awesome that Mengniu can't sit still. The official Weibo reacts faster than the real sponsor Yili. Yili, it's up to you."
"Not bad, it's very smooth and fast. The property at this price is worth it, but why don't I have an invoice?"
"Good stuff, cheap price, fast logistics"
"It's very good, the response is very fast, I only use it to watch videos, I feel quite satisfied"
. . . Rubbish
"The battery is relatively durable and the resolution is high. Except for the poor pixels, everything else meets my requirements."
"It takes 7-8 hours to charge, and the adapter is 5V 1A. I have to give a bad review. It’s too bullying. It means that if you play for one day, you have to charge it the next day!"
"I bought it for 848 yuan on June 28 and now I buy it for 799 yuan, a full difference of 49 yuan. I applied for price protection and said it was not within the scope of protection, which is too inhumane."
The gift I bought for my mother is very nice. My mother likes it very much.
I bought it a few years ago and have been using it for a while. It's pretty good.
"So far, everything is going well with the tablet. I was just a little disappointed when I bought it because it said the freebies had run out."
"It's okay, but the battery isn't very durable. Overall, it's okay."
"Tuli Tuji is so picky that he didn’t even give me a pair of headphones. At first I thought he would give me a case, but I was too naive. Spending 1,900 on this thing really hit my head."
"Bad mobile phone, often stuck! Never buy Huawei again, it’s just too flashy! You can see their dog eyes at p10!"
It's pretty good so far. The first one was stolen less than a month after I bought it. The side buttons I bought this time are not very sensitive. Others are pretty good. Watching movies is good.
Huawei's mobile phones are average and more expensive than others of the same level.
So useful! Awesome..........
"The new model is based on Android 7.0 system, which is very good."
"The appearance and quality are okay, but the return button is inconvenient to use."
I have stopped drinking Mengniu for a long time.
"Not ideal, the picture is not very clear"
"If I don’t drink milk after returning to China, I don’t understand why people still buy Mengniu =_= People who are still selling Mengniu can only say that they are looking for death."
"It was agreed to be delivered on the 25th. Why was it not delivered until the afternoon of the 26th? No one called to say hello. I chose JD.com because of its logistics speed, but this time I was disappointed."
Looking for Mengniu Guangming~~~~
I just took a sip of Mengniu Yiyoute that my mother forced into me. I felt so uneasy. Isn’t it life-threatening? Mengniu~~~Mengniu. . .
"The screen flickered half a day after I bought it. What’s the reason? Contact the seller, but the seller will ignore you. What rubbish, it disgraces the Huawei brand."
"Very good to use, a good purchase"
"It’s so big that I can’t even hold it in my hands, so I hope the quality won’t disappoint!"
"I bought it for my baby to watch TV. The speed is very fast, and the screen is very clear. It downloads things very quickly. There is no lag at all when playing games. It also comes with a lot of stuff. It’s really worth it."
I’ve been using it for a day and can’t turn it on. I’m so disappointed and I’m planning to return it.
"The stuff is absolutely authentic, and the gifts are great. I gave it to my mother-in-law as a Mother's Day gift, and she likes it very much."
"Speaker, the sound is too small, too small, too small?"
Today's basketball game is over~~One of the top three teams took away a basketball. . . It seems there is also Mengniu milk? Rich rewards~
"Same model, same model, why is the phone I bought online lighter than other people’s phones? I feel a bit cheated! May I ask why this is? Is it a prototype machine?"
"Good, good, good, big screen, yes, yes, yes"
Not easy to use! I couldn’t pass anything on the exam the next day.
It’s so useful. My son likes it very much.
"No, the quality is too low"
"Just received it, I feel good, but today the product is packaged in a big carton and a small box, and the cushioning pad is not enough."
Not bad. I compared many models and finally bought this one. It’s really good.
"The phone is pretty good, easy to use, and will always support domestically produced phones!"
"The camera effect is so bad, it’s not even as good as a phone costing 600 yuan. The biggest advantage is that the screen is big and cheap. If you want to take pictures, don’t buy this one."
You get what you pay for. The after-sales service is not good. No replacement will be given after 2 days. There is a problem with the mobile phone’s connection to the network. It is particularly stuck. I forgot to convey positive energy. JD.com’s after-sales service is like a dog. It’s better not to buy electrical appliances from JD.com. I forgot. as everyone knows
"Fortunately, I couldn’t bear to eat it because it was expensive. It was too scary! Halo. Compared with the 50-cent milk popsicles sold by Mengniu, which are not hygienic, this high-priced, low-quality, bad brand is even more deceptive. I will definitely not eat them again."
"I just arrived today, I’ll give it a while to see if it’s good and I’ll add a review."
"Jingdong is getting worse and worse. If there is a problem, the customer service will not care. Jingdong’s online customer service has never responded. Don’t be angry because you buy something. Be careful when purchasing!"
"No gifts at all, bad review"
"It's said to be okay as a gift, but because the logistics is so bad, it's quite impressive, so I can only give it two stars."
"The product itself is good, and this little thing is actually not valuable, but JD.com’s behavior is very infuriating! ! Warning everyone! !"
"It's very good to use and very stable, but I feel tired after looking at the screen for a long time and it's a bit dazzling. But still very smooth"
"After using it for two months, it got stuck and didn't work well. My mother's was bought from a sales store and it works very well. The change details page of this WeChat wallet cannot be opened! It just doesn’t go smoothly! Bad review!"
"When I make a phone call, it often only vibrates and there is no sound. Just restart it and it will be fine."
Streaks are not good at all
"After the boycott of Sanlu, we started to boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu. Boycott Mengniu."
It makes no sense to like you. I just love being with you. Mengniu Yili Ice Cream.
Donate a box of expired Mengniu
The logistics was fast and the goods arrived within a few hours. I personally think the Wi-Fi version is easy to use.
I downloaded a lot of useless software. I suspect it is a repaired machine. It looks okay but is of no use.
Mengniu is in tragedy again
I placed the order in the morning and received it in the afternoon. It was very fast. It looks great and the speed is pretty good!
"My mobile phone is not working well, it is laggy and often freezes. I will never buy a mobile phone on JD.com again."
"After initial use, I feel good, that is, WIFI"
"Very good, pretty good, I like it very much"
"I bought it for an old man, but it hasn’t been used yet because I’m not at home and he doesn’t know how to cut the card. But I heard the old man said he doesn’t have earphones? ? ? Don’t all mobile phones come with headphones? This is the first time I bought a mobile phone without earphones and I was disappointed."
"I was hit by bird droppings for the second time in my life. Then today I didn’t bring a towel to take a shower, and I didn’t take washing powder to wash my clothes. I went to the supermarket to buy milk. If I like drinking Mengniu, I bought Yili instead. I am really miserable today. ."
I took a fancy to the introduction of the Android system software store. Huawei's is fast and overall good.
"Purchased many times, not bad, Huawei is trustworthy"
"Very good, fast, runs smoothly, but the standby time is a little short."
"Centralized purchasing, moderate price. Overall it can be used"
"I received the item and it seems that the response is not very fast, but it is still usable."
Not as good as expected. . . . . . .
"It’s okay, the price is cheap, and the delivery speed is okay"
"Just bought it and it was reduced by 200, how disgusting!"
"It's bigger than I expected, but the combination of this phone tablet and the eight-inch phone confused me. I originally wanted to buy a phone tablet, but ended up buying a big phone! But still quite satisfied!"
"It's stuck terribly, throw it away."
"Too bad, poor product and poor service. Consider it carefully!"
I like to drink Mengniu Big Fruit! Those who are thoughtful will remember (^.^)
"The logistics speed is very fast, and the machine looks okay"
"Flawless sound, great screen, production date is April 2016."
"Jingdong is rubbish, it can’t deliver what it promises! Because of trivial matters, I couldn't guarantee the delivery time, which not only caused me delays, but also damaged my reputation! Jingdong is awesome, amazing, not afraid of this! Sooner or later it will over!"
"The speed of the large screen is pretty good, and it is cost-effective. It is very suitable for the elderly. Huawei deserves to be the number one brand in China, and the products are good! You'll know once you use it."
"Overall, it’s good. During the period, the price was reduced and I was refunded the price difference. I give JD.com a thumbs up!"
My favorite drink is Mengniu Youyi C. I’m here: # Zhaoqing Industrial and Commercial Vocational and Technical College# http:t.cn/zl1d037
good! like! Thin and light!
The tablet runs stably and is more cost-effective compared to Samsung and the like.
"Haha, so funny. . . +10010 Cutting cakes is not poisonous. At least cutting cakes is not poisonous! Mengniu is indeed more cheating than cutting cakes. Do these idiots like Mengniu think cutting cakes is high-end?"
"After it was repaired, I briefly checked it and found no problems. It was left unused for another five or six days. When I took it out and used it, there was no vibration, the vibration was broken! I guess it was damaged when I replaced the screen!"
"I don’t like Huawei, really"
"There is no invoice, and the packaging is different from the physical store. The customer service also said that it is intact. How to explain? Can I return it?"
I love drinking Guanyi Milk so much! It tastes really good! One bottle a day for good health and good mood??Please stop commenting on Mengniu. .
It is said that 16G only comes with 10G. The product does not match what is said.
"Not bad, you can try it"
"Although I don’t like Mengniu, I haven’t had it for many years, but this is different. Thank you."
Baby is very satisfied
The touch screen is a mess
"Very good, the logistics is super fast. I bought it for my daughter. I like it very much."
It's okay to use. Sometimes there will be lags. . Worth the price. .
"I don’t know why I can’t connect to WLAN and get online, I’m so annoyed. It can be used on mobile phones, but not on tablets. The web page always fails to open and becomes unresponsive."
"I was promised some gifts, but I didn’t see any."
Very good. I gave it to my dad for Father’s Day.
Mengniu banana milk tastes good@erwa??
The quality of the mobile phone is very good. I have always used Huawei.
"The express delivery is really rubbish. What the hell, I just called you and said it wouldn’t come. It’s simply irresponsible."
"The reaction is too slow, like an old ox pulling a cart and a calf playing with it."
"The sound effect is very good, the tablet is also good-looking and practical, and it is a good deal to buy for events."
Mengniu and Yili are absolutely fine! The problem is with the unruly people! …
Mengniu’s constant negative news is jaw-dropping. Mr. Niu should be pragmatic first!
"It’s not great, it doesn’t give anything away, it’s a bit deceptive, if I had known about it, I wouldn’t have wanted it, and the customer service always calls me “honey”, is it almost cuckolding her husband if I give it to her!"
I feel safe buying things from JD.com. I always buy them from JD.com.
Happy to eat baby Mengniu
Mengniu Niu is leaving for Yunnan! ! ! So exciting! ! !
They clamored to boycott Mengniu but still drank
"The price dropped quickly after I bought it, so the bad reviews make anyone feel uncomfortable buying it."
The screen flickered on the first day after I received it. It flickered on and off. Note: The brightness adjustment was turned off. Calling customer service was also perfunctory and irresponsible. Please don’t be deceived in the future.
"It’s second-hand, and it also contains software downloaded by others. It’s really a scam. The screensaver and protective case it comes with are not useful."
"My girlfriend bought it, it feels pretty good, and the overall condition is okay..."
"It feels okay, the sound effects and resolution are great. PS: It cannot be played while charging."
"I like it very much. After using it for two days, I feel that the tablet is very responsive and I can watch TV very clearly. I love it and give it good reviews."
"Mengniu has updated its packaging, and it looks good."
"Several phones at home are Huawei, and I use mate8. I feel that this tablet m3 is like a large mate8. It runs at a good speed and can be operated by hand. It is not too big and it feels good to watch movies in horizontal screen."
"For this price, it’s very good and the price/performance ratio is okay."
"The workmanship is really good, the sound quality is great, and the screen quality is very good. It is well deserved to be the number one domestic brand tablet in 2016-17."
Why didn't you give me an invoice? Why?
Bad review for not having headphones! ! !
"How should I put it? After buying it, it got stuck once. I upgraded the system and it got better. There were also minor lags a few times in the middle. Even though the price was high, after all, I just bought it..."
"Too bad, the battery is not good, the feel is not good, Meizu will be black for life."
"The appearance and workmanship are very exquisite, the brightness is slightly lower when watching videos, and the sound is also relatively quiet."
Cheap and good quality! What a great deal! First-class Jingdong service! Thank you Jingdong!
The film isn’t great but the tablet is okay… and the price is okay
"Satisfied, overall good"
"The famous mobile and Unicom dual 4G! The delivery was China Mobile 4G and China Unicom 2G! Dear buyers, please take a good look at your machine and don’t let the seller play the ten-number game and be deceived!"
"It keeps telling me that the sd is abnormal, but when I insert the sd card into other machines, there is no problem at all. By the way, Huawei’s attitude towards problems with the P10 is only one star. I will not buy anything from Huawei in the future."
The charger broke after three days of use. I contacted the seller this morning and left a message but no response.
"The goods arrived the same day, and the delivery speed was incredible. Honor of Kings cannot be found directly in the app and can only be downloaded through the web page. Play without lag"
"I received the tablet, and I am very satisfied with it. It is as expected. I am not disappointed. I will try it for the first time. I will review it later."
"It’s not great, the screen brightness isn’t enough, it’s for parents, just make do with it."
It's a very good tablet. It has good sound. The sound quality is also very good. I don't know if it is stuck when playing games. It needs to be verified. The overall feeling is very good. I support domestic products and trust Huawei. The attitude of the JD Express guy is also very good. I give it a thumbs up and a great experience.
"When I went back to Zhaoqing for a job fair, I saw a dreamy castle at the entrance of RT-Mart. I was instantly attracted to it. The first thing I thought was that it was used for events by Mengniu or Yili. Then I took a closer look."
"As expected of a second-hand product, there is a small hole on the back of the phone. I really doubt it was returned."
"The tablet is not good. There is a problem with the sound button, but everything else is fine. They said they would give away gifts and then they gave them away while supplies lasted. I gave them away when they ran out."
Normally want to return the product
"Overall, it should be the best Android tablet currently, a gift for my mother."
Not bad but a bit expensive. I have always liked shopping on JD.com
I have bought products from JD.com too many times. This time I feel disgusted by JD.com. The after-sales service is so bad that even one star is unnecessary.
"Very cool, very domineering, Huawei is still good, I bought it for others, others are very happy to get the goods."
Playing Happy Match and King of Glory is very smooth. Play lossless music and watch movies delicately and smoothly. I am very satisfied with my shopping at JD.com this time. Come again next time!
It’s so rubbish. It broke after 6 days of use. I don’t even want to give it to you.
He is a liar and will never buy a tablet from JD.com again.
I bought it for someone else and it was a great time to watch the movie.
"Good performance, fast speed, considerate service and affordable price"
"Logistics took 6 days to arrive, no invoice, no thimble"
"Big liar, even more deceptive than a Ponzi scheme, why would you send a bunch of scrap iron contraband to my house? The machine is like a defective product from a small workshop, and there are no gifts, invoices, or warranty."
"Cheaper than supermarkets, delivery is convenient, and the courier is very dedicated, delivering it directly upstairs on a hot day."
"Overall, it was pretty good. The express arrived early the next morning. The machine shows that it was shipped from the factory in April this year. Good review!"
"Under the projection of peeling the skin is a banana, and Naité is a new product~ The correct answer is ~Mengniu Banana Naité~"
I just got it. I bought it for my mother. It has the same system as her mobile phone. I learned it very quickly. The system is smooth and easy to use.
"Broader and wider! To give a thumbs up, you have to add up to ten words."
"Very good, this is the second one. I bought it as a gift."
"The stuff is good stuff, JD.com is not serious. Yesterday I bought a mobile phone on JD.com for 999, and today I bought a mobile phone for 899. I applied for a price guarantee but was rejected. Fortunately, I was given a 7-day no-questions-asked return policy."
"I used it for half a month before reviewing it. The screen is clear and the fingerprint response is fast. The only drawback is that the battery is not durable. Everything else is perfect. In short, I am very satisfied with the tablet!"
This one-star package is for JD.com. There is no padding protection. The corners of the box are deformed and crushed. The item has not been used yet. I will review it after use.
The touch screen is not sensitive and is not suitable for playing games. It is only suitable for watching TV and listening to music.
"The tablet is very good and clear, the input response is quite fast, and the battery is quite durable, but the memory shows 16G as 1OG memory. Overall quite satisfied."
"Very useful, very good"
"Good quality and low price, easy to use, fast Internet access, I use it all the time, it is worth buying..."
"It’s really good. Ever since the Huawei brand was recognized by Chinese people, I have always supported domestic production and independent brands. I will only buy Huawei in the future."
"The logistics took me 3 days to deliver it. To be honest, I don’t want to give it even 1 star!"
"Jingdong stuff is great. . The courier guy's service attitude is really good, I really like it. . ."
"Very good, worth buying for everyone!"
I suspect this is a refurbished phone. New phones will not be like this. Huawei's manufacturing is really good. The Amap map that comes with the system is still unresponsive. I bought an x2 before and the system did not come with Amap.
It was over a hundred dollars cheaper just after I bought it. What do you mean? You can’t buy anything on JD.com!
"Very good, cost-effective, much better than I expected, like it"
I like it very much. Logistics and delivery are fast. I received it the next day.
"It's pretty good, lightweight, big screen, no lag."
"Very good, support me."
"Very easy to use, fast and worth having!"
The flatbed truck is very easy to use. The function of supporting domestic Android is very powerful. The software is very complete and supports domestic Android.
"The price was reduced within two days of buying it, and the difference was 500 yuan! I’ve bought so many things on JD.com, it’s really a scam! Ask for explanation"
"It only took me a day to evaluate it. Overall, it’s pretty good. It’s just a little inconvenient that there’s no flash, which means I need a flashlight when I go out at night... There was a little hiccup when it was first delivered, but it was solved perfectly."
Sound quality is too bad
"I felt uncomfortable drinking milk, which made me say the wrong thing for no reason: ""Mengniu tastes terrible. I will never buy Yili again, go to tmd Nestlé."""
"There is no electronic invoice, the machine is stuck, garbage!"
"Fried scallion rolls are my favorite. Paired with Mengniu, it’s the most nutritious breakfast. I like chicken wings~! Mengniu"
"Really good PAD, you don’t have to worry about learning English"
The tablet is very good and smooth. It is good for children to play games and watch movies.
"Very good, there is no problem for now, please use it for a while"
"I originally purchased the same model for users to use, and the reviews from users were very good."
"Mengniu's vanilla milk tastes like melted ice cubes. . . I bought the sesame seeds to kill you, is it easy for me? I had to pour it in and eat it. . ."
"Parallel import, too bad, not satisfied"
"The courier had a bad attitude and refused to inspect the goods. As a result, after receiving the goods, I found that the touch screen was not sensitive. It was almost Chinese New Year and I didn’t want to return it for a replacement."
"Very stuck! Very stuck! Very stuck! I tolerated this, and it even restarted automatically! ! ! How many days has it been? ! You should also be serious about refurbishing your machine! ! ! Depend on! ! !"
"A very good phablet, suitable for watching videos."
Very easy to use and good
"I just bought it less than a week ago, and the price was reduced*. I don’t know what happened, and I strongly request a return."
I have stopped drinking Mengniu for many years. Um. I haven’t drank Mengniu Yili for a long time.
"Big sellers are more reliable. The stuff is very good, very satisfied."
Mengniu manager was detained for tampering with product dates (from http:t.cn/zWRsenA
"After using it for a period of time, Huawei is good."
"Mengniu won the Wellcome ""Outstanding"" Dairy Food Award! @mengniudairy"
I bought it for my child. He said it is very easy to use and the Internet is fast. It is worth buying.
Too stingy. Not even willing to give away a condom
"It's so rubbish, not to mention the screen is too small, and the tempered film won't stick flat at all. I replaced four tempered films. My dad said it's okay, but I always feel sick."
"This is the most easily broken screen among all the mobile phones I have ever used! ! You can buy it if you think you won’t lose it at all, otherwise forget it! ! Shake your little hand gently and change the screen 599! ! ! !"
"Very good product. I have been buying electronic products from JD.com, I have always believed in JD.com and supported JD.com"
This is the third one I bought. It was a good deal on Double Eleven. It was 60 yuan cheaper than when I bought it last year. The price on Double Eleven was 639.
"The genuine product is super easy to use, and I bought it at a flash sale, which is a great deal! I like it very much. The call version is super practical and unrestricted. I’m really happy! Not much to say about the speed of JD.com, it has always been super fast??"
"There is nothing to say about the 2K screen. The dual stereo speakers and Harman Kardon sound effects are great. I am very satisfied with the M3. The price is moderate. Anyway, it is good. It is great to watch movies and listen to music. It would be great if it comes with headphones."
The machine has died and cannot be turned off or used.
I like Mengniu before bed.
"A very satisfying purchase! Jingdong Mall and Jingdong Express are both great! The outer packaging of the received goods is intact, and the treasure inside is also intact. Special thanks to the delivery person Mr. Zhao!"
"A big mobile phone, of course, it is mainly used as a tablet. It is of good quality and easy to use. It is worth buying. It is of high quality and low price."
I like it very much. I hesitated for a long time before buying it. I like it very much and it is very easy to use.
"Just like staying away from Mengniu, normal people must stay away from @Eastern Airlines."
"It's easy to use, but if it doesn't come with a shell, it doesn't come with an actinic film."
"Except for Mengniu, I am too lazy to say bad words about this kind of bank news~"
"Yes, the price/performance ratio is very high. The only regret is that the resolution is a bit low."
"I think it's pretty easy to use, but the resolution is a bit poor. I think the resolution is at least 2k."
"Rubbish, did you say you could make a phone call? Why can't I make calls when I send it? There's no place to insert a card."
I have insisted not to buy Mengniu and Yili for a long time. I have insisted not to buy Mengniu for almost a year. . . When will Mengniu go bankrupt? I have stopped buying Mengniu for several months. I will hold on until it goes bankrupt.
I checked that it is genuine and it is very smooth to use. I will buy it next time!
"The price changes too much, it’s too expensive, I’m not satisfied."
The resolution is not very high and the camera is very blurry. It’s really not worth it!
"Very good, very energy-saving and very durable"
Bad reviews. It’s hard to use if you can’t move.
I don’t drink Mengniu anyway.
"In order to buy it to play Honor of Kings, I originally read the reviews and said it was stuck, but I haven't had it so far. I haven't downloaded a lot of software because of the small memory. A thousand yuan machine is fine, and the sound effect is very good. It has two speakers."
"After using it for a long time, it feels very good, very clear, and the sound is also very good. The price/performance ratio is very good."
"Junk product, lots of problems, whoever buys it will regret it"
This kid is so pitiful. He accidentally went crazy after watching a movie. He didn’t even need to drink Mengniu before he collapsed like this.
"Does anyone use him to trick his teammates in King of Glory? It’s too big and you can’t operate it as you wish! Watching the video is awesome, the system is smooth and there is nothing wrong with the machine!"
"The website said that a protective case would be provided, but it was not found when it was actually delivered. It said that it would be shipped while supplies last. This is a trick."
"I didn’t receive the item. I didn’t see it either…. Gave money? There is no product. I don’t even know when I bought this thing. Anyway, it was not delivered to me. Inexplicably, the transaction was completed and I was not refunded."
"Don't buy Mengniu on Friday. If you don't buy it, you'll be sorry for Mengniu!"
The after-sales service is so poor that I have to give you nonsense for a long time just to issue an invoice.
It’s lightweight and the metal looks very textured. I’ve already bought the second one.
"I don’t know if it’s good or not, but it hasn’t been used yet."
The screen is really big ~ the effect is pretty good! It’s just that the price is unstable~
I haven’t drank Mengniu for a long time. I haven’t drank Mengniu for a long time...
"Value for money, pretty good."
Can Mengniu sue the rumor mongers?
The tablet is very powerful. It doesn’t get hot when watching videos and doesn’t play games very much.
The stuff is very good. We support Huawei and domestic products. JD.com is very powerful.
I placed an order in the morning and received an additional earphone as a gift in the morning. I told the customer service that they would not send it to me and I would be angry! The standards are different in the same morning. I really can’t bear the fall and feel uncomfortable mentally!
Mobile phone batteries are really not durable!
I once saw this sentence in a Mengniu Group factory and benefited a lot.
You must not drink Mengniu! ! Angry!
The data cable is broken
It’s very good for the elderly at home.
"The touch screen is very difficult to use, it always retracts automatically, and sometimes it doesn't respond. Very annoying."
"So disgusting, so disgusting. Mengniu, what do you want to do?"
"The system is easy to operate, especially suitable for middle-aged and elderly people, and the size is suitable!"
"The championship team is truly worthy of the title. Oh yeah, but I feel like Mengniu is such a big sponsor and the prizes today are not that impressive."
"The stuff is good, but that’s it. It has nothing to do with the seller. I thought it was cheap on Double Eleven, but in fact it’s the same price now."
"It cannot be opened as a gift, but it looks fine from the parameters."
The Tragedy of Mengniu: Being uneducated is terrible
"After a few weeks, there was some lag when booting."
I was dissatisfied that the first shipment was not delivered in three days. The second shipment arrived in one day after half a month of use. The camera had a plastic look and was blurry. The customer service told me to pay personally. It is really difficult to support domestic products. ????
"I didn't see anything since it was sent back to my hometown, but my family members said it was pretty good and it hasn't been installed yet. Awaiting additional comments later!"
"The express delivery is very fast, and the tablet works well."
Mengniu Guanyi Milk with mulberry fruit pieces is good. Strawberry is my favorite. It tastes good.
"It's really easy to use, the installation is getting more and more stable, and it's more open than OS. Huawei is awesome."
"Very good, response speed is good, screen definition is high"
"The mobile phone is very good, but it is expensive and they will not make up the difference."
good good good
"Mengniu Youyi C tastes good, better than Cass"
"I actually admire Mengniu. At least they tell the truth, that is, ""there is no problem supplying goods to Hong Kong."""
"The water heater is very easy to use, and the service provided by the seller is also very good. It is a good and honest seller. Hereby give Taobao the highest honor and full five-star praise!"
Mengniu's real fruit juice turns out rotten coconut! ! So disgusting... There are pictures to prove it @Read the Bible together
"I have always believed in JD.com, but this time I was so disappointed. After the tablet was delivered, it automatically shut down after being turned on and had a blue screen and was speechless. It won't turn on even after charging."
"Big brands are different, they run smoothly and their sound is surging."
"Not happy, the price was reduced as soon as I bought it!"
"The baby is very good, the color is beautiful, the hand feels very comfortable, and the response is very fast. I will visit you often in the future."
The Mengniu high calcium milk my husband bought had small moths in it. It was really disgusting. I will never buy Mengniu milk again.
"Two days after buying it, there is a lag."
The logistics is fast and the courier is very polite. It is genuine.
"The resolution of the tablet is so poor that it hurts my eyes to look at it. This is a major failure of Huawei products, which is sad. . . . ."
This is the ninth time I have purchased it. The quality is very good. I feel confident in using it. I will continue to come here next time!
"Too bad, it always shuts down automatically in standby mode."
I bought it for my son. It’s pretty good. I’ll continue to support JD.com. The delivery service is very good.
"Grassroots officials in Inner Mongolia: There is nothing wrong with Mengniu Yili, but the source is unsafe http:t.cn/zjzlb3I (Shared from @Sina Finance) All birds will jump out"
"Beautiful appearance, very durable battery, enough for watching videos, good reviews"
"The mobile phone is very good, the customer service is good, and the express delivery is also very good."
"I wanted to refund, but the invoice was lost and money was deducted, and it was quite a lot! ! !"
"After using it for a while, the whole family is a fan of Huawei."
"Yes, I have been using it for a while and everything is fine."
"Looks okay, better than expected"
"The machine is easy to use, the sound is loud, and the sound effect is good. It is a big brand, the quality is good, and the delivery is fast."
"The quality is so bad. I bought it without installing a card. I use it as a tablet. Today I asked to install a card, but it didn’t respond. It’s not a mobile phone if it can’t install a card. It’s rubbish. I’ll regret buying it."
"Poor, poor, poor. It’s not because of poor quality, but because Jingdong’s details are so poor. When I open the outer packaging, it’s full of black dirt. I want to give it to the employees as prizes. How can I get rid of it like this?"
"When I got it back, I saw that the box was old and there were still downloaded songs in the machine. Damn it."
The tablet is very easy to use. I bought one last year and this is the second one this year. The videos are very clear and the sound is good. I will buy a third one if I have the opportunity.
"Used it for a week, very satisfied! It is a genuine system with smooth and high resolution. I give it a five-star rating! ! ???"
Bad review. Someone else returned it to me.
"The battery is good and durable, and the movies are not stuck and the colors are good"
I’m not happy that the price was reduced as soon as I bought it.
"It is quite good that the tablet can achieve this level, which shows that the quality of domestic products is very high, it is economical and can make calls. Except for the slightly lower pixels of the camera, it is almost impeccable. Playing Honor of Kings is particularly fun! Very satisfied"
There is no invoice. I confirmed that there was an invoice when I purchased it. Why not?
The logistics speed is very fast and the quality is pretty good. This is the second Huawei tablet I have used at home. Huawei products are still trustworthy.
It was okay at first. I haven’t used it much and it’s not mine. I’ll give it a good review first and then add more comments later.
It didn’t take long for it to start jamming! Crashes! !
"Alas, the feeling of being deceived will automatically arise again. . . A bit stuck."
"Nothing but big! The price is too expensive, it comes with back-end software to deceive traffic, it is impure, and there is a conspiracy, be careful!"
It's a bit stuck and not very easy to use.
"If something really goes wrong, no matter how awesome the public relations department is, it can't save Mengniu. Just go to sleep."
"I bought it for my mother, but the invoice I promised was not issued and I never received it. I contacted customer service to no avail and kept saying it was issued. But the problem is that I didn’t receive it. I rummaged through it inside and out. This makes me very unhappy."
"I thought I didn't see the factory date clearly, so I bought such an old machine at the original price, and I lost money."
"This is the second time I have purchased this water heater. The quality is assured, the workmanship is fine, the design is reasonable, and it heats very quickly. It is for the elderly. I am very satisfied!"
"Harmanton, I don’t even have headphones, how can I experience the sound effect? ??Bad review"
Nothing but a charger and headphones.
"There is a slit at the top of the machine. I don’t know if it was not installed in place during installation, or it was caused during the logistics and transportation process. It feels very uncomfortable. It is necessary to go to the official website to verify the authenticity."
"The smoothness is okay, but the screen is not as good as Apple's."
"The black edges are large, and everything else is quite satisfactory, except for the small degumming at the rounded corners of the bottom cover."
"Don’t drink, don’t drink Yili or Mengniu, but you will still be exposed to polluted air and water. But the head of the Football Association will be dismissed, but the head of the Dairy and Wine Industry Association will not be dismissed? Every cause must have an effect. normal. Repost Weibo"
"The system is weak and the companies are unscrupulous. Why should Mengniu blame ""negative reports"" for its decline in performance? ——Shared from Global Network http:t.cn/zW19mKg"
The battery won’t last until the phone goes dark even if you don’t use it much for a day
"Satisfied. The customer service staff is very good. He answered all my questions and didn’t mind my ink. Thank you. The after-sales service is also good. But the after-sales installation is very expensive. 120. What a scam. If I had known better, I would have found someone to install it. ,"
"Very good, very smooth, easy to use, my daughter likes it very much."
"If you place an order on 618 on the same day, the price will be reduced by RMB 100 the next day. Doesn’t 618 claim to have extremely low prices within a month? I applied for price insurance N times but got no response. Do you think I have to wait until the application statute of limitations has expired before telling me that price insurance is no longer available? It seems the only option is to complain."
It’s a very unpleasant shopping experience. It’s a rubbish merchant that deceives consumers. There are so many rubbish gimmicks and events. They are all deceptive. Be careful when buying.
"First: the appearance is not metal, second: the color is different, and third: the game is stuck when playing."
You are simply amazing Mengniu
"Second-hand mobile phones are sold to ordinary people as new mobile phones, JD.com is too dark"
"Yes, super delicious and authentic Mengniu~~"
Boycott Mengniu and never drink Mengniu products.
"There is nothing wrong with the mobile phone, the problem is that there is no invoice"
The merchant is very stingy and won’t give away tempered film or leather case.
"I have just been playing with it for two days and I really like the design style of the Huawei tablet. The black edges are a bit big, but it does not affect the use and it is very cheap. Music playback is great and the screen is relatively clear"
The phone is too hot to touch
I bought it in time for an event and it was cheaper than the official website. The workmanship is exquisite and it looks classy. The express delivery is also very fast!
Received as a gift. Feedback: The screen clarity is average. Others are fine.
"The logistics was very fast, but the protective film was not sent. I asked the customer service, but they ignored me for two days and did not give me a reply! I just wanted to ask JD.com, where is the protective film? Flying!"
"I obviously bought Netcom, but received Mobile Netcom. When I went to customer service, they pushed me back and forth or ignored me. There is a price difference between the two. Jingdong deceived consumers and the product was not the right version."
Grandpa likes it very much. The screen is extra large.
Not bad! The processor doesn’t work!
"The tablet runs smoothly, and the phone is also Huawei and supports Huawei! I don’t know how long it takes to charge, but I charge it at night and it’s fully charged in the morning. The resolution is very high, it’s fun to watch movies, and the JD packaging is okay."
It's really good. I always buy it from here. It's convenient and fast. It saves effort and is the best choice for shopping.
"It feels good in hand, the size is right, and it’s very fast."
"It arrived the next day, stir-fried chicken quickly! I have been using it for a while and have no problems. It is cheap and the size is suitable. It is suitable for my mother to watch TV series!"
"Cheap and good quality, just what I want"
We don’t drink Mengniu!
It’s not easy to use. There are always problems with the network. This was not the case with previous mobile phones. The memory is simply not enough. Don’t buy it. You’ll regret it.
There is no need for a reason to reject Mengniu. I saw the disgusting Mengniu
The baby has been received. I am very satisfied with the price. Five-star rating!
No power comes in. The quality isn't that great either. Just bought it a few days ago.
I had an upset stomach in the middle of the night and it was just pure insomnia. I didn’t dare to buy Mengniu yogurt in the future.
"I've been feeling very angry lately, so I'm eating ice cream to calm down the heat. Unfortunately, I can't buy Mengniu's. Although this one isn't very delicious, it at least cools my heart."
"This is the second one, cheaper than last year and no gifts. Watching movies and playing games is no problem."
This is the second time I bought it. It’s very exciting.
"The stuff is okay, but the photos are blurry. I’m not satisfied with the packaging. I don’t even have an invoice."
"How awesome is Mengniu’s background? How can such a company still survive? Oh my God, Mengniu is so shameless!"
Express delivery deserves a thumbs up. I placed the order in the afternoon and received it the next morning.
"Because after buying it for two or three days, the price dropped by 100. So unreliable!"
"It feels very good, the sound quality is also very good, and the price is high"
"Huawei M3 is really good. It has fast speed, large capacity and clear photos. JD.com has great activities. The price is right and it supports domestic products."
"I am a loyal customer of Huawei and a loyal customer of JD.com. Only buy JD.com's self-operated products, the service is good, the speed is fast, and the price is reasonable. like"
I have stopped buying Mengniu for a long time. garbage enterprise
"Very pretty. It’s also very useful. It is mainly used to read documents and answer questions, but I don’t know about the game performance. I bought another case myself and felt much more at ease."
So far it looks pretty good
"When I purchased it, it said that it would come with a data cable, a 16G SD card, a film, and a stand. But in the end, I only got the stand. It’s really a shameless deception."
Things are very good and achieved the effect I expected.
"The stuff is good. I have been using it for a while and it has pretty good automatic power off and heating. The store’s service attitude is very good. If I need it in the future, I will buy from this store again."
"Well, I heard it's quite cheap. Haha, I shed tears."
Cell phones are no good! The photo is not clear either! Express delivery is still very fast!
The operation is okay and the logistics is also very fast!
"Damn it, this tablet doesn’t show that the tablet is online, and it’s so laggy when playing, so bad?"
"Leave a comment and post the order. In order to get the headphones, will you send them to me?"
Is it Mengniu or Guangming?
"That’s right, it’s you, my favorite Mengniu"
"Mengniu yogurt is too unpleasant to drink, with strong white sugar and strong flavor..."
"Super good, super satisfied!"
"The mobile phone I just bought can only be charged to 40% of the power, and the customer service has not responded. This is my second purchase. How does the merchant provide after-sales service and ensure quality?"
"Not bad, everything imitates Apple, employees use it"
"I bought it to play Honor of Kings, but it’s stuck and there are bugs. The winning rates of commonly used heroes are not displayed! ! ! How come a phone worth hundreds of dollars doesn’t lag? Not only does this tablet have lags when playing, but it always fails when pressing the direction keys and skills at the same time!"
"The battery is durable and the system response is pretty good. Huawei tablets are recommended for everyone to use. The response is not as good as the computer. That is normal. After all, the configuration is there. There is no pressure on the movie King of Pesticides and so on."
"The goods have been received, not bad. There are just no headphones. A brand as big as Huawei doesn’t even give away headphones?"
"The winter solstice passed like this. It was the first time I was not at home, and I felt so uncomfortable. Fortunately, I have someone to accompany me, and fortunately I will be fine at the end of the world. Everything is expected! Get up early tomorrow and grab a seat at Mengniu! Good night world, sweet dreams"
The resolution is too low.
"I was completely deceived. Damn it, I was obviously in M3 when I filmed it."
"Not bad, very good, fits well and feels good in the hand. Comfortable to use."
"I placed the order on the 12th and received it on the 13th. On the morning of the 15th, I noticed that there were black stripes on it. I went to a mobile phone store and asked if it was broken. I was just unlucky. The boss said that I couldn’t get a replacement, so I had to get the old one myself."
"Bad, bad, bad! ! ! Price reduced after purchase! ! !"
The Japanese said they would not send me any gifts. The price is relatively high
Boycott all questionable milk. It would be unreasonable for garbage companies like Yilimeng Niu not to collapse.
"Good reviews, no smearing issues encountered, runs smoothly! The screen is clear and the weight is appropriate. I am satisfied and support Huawei!"
Disgusting Mengniu
"Just so-so, what do you want with a few hundred yuan!"
"Damn it, I promised that even if I paid over 1,000, I didn’t even respond to 100. The customer service will handle it. Oh, this is my first bad review!"
It was so good that I bought twelve of them at once and used them as prizes for the sales team. They were very classy!
"The resolution of this thing is really poor, and the sound quality is also very poor. I guess it’s because it’s cheap! It doesn't get stuck when I use it now. I wonder what will happen in the future?"
"It's pretty good, great, a fighter among Android tablets. . . ."
"After eating a bottle of yogurt (Guanyi Milk), it shoots up to the sky, so cool! It must come from the stomach. Give it a few more shots, one shot = 2500 bottles of Guanyi Milk. Thank you Mengniu, and thank you Fangda Special Steel for supporting me."
"My mom uses it at home. It’s fine for watching videos and making phone calls. Don’t expect anything else. The worst part is that it doesn’t even have a flash. Anyway, I won’t buy Huawei next time."
"Bought for my best friend, she likes it very much. And the price is very cheap!"
"Shipping is fast, the tablet is good, and the packaging is complete."
It’s been a long time since I bought it before I reviewed it. I really don’t feel that much.
"It's very easy to use. It's the first time I've used it, but the battery isn't as durable as stated."
The service in this store is terrible. There were quality issues with the phone after I bought it. I returned it to the manufacturer and sent it back to remind everyone not to buy a phone from this store. This is the most unsatisfactory shopping experience I have ever had.
"I will never buy anything from JD.com again! I’m also a Diamond member, so I’ll go! What I was given was returned goods, which was very disappointing!"
I received the tablet via JD Express. I have to say that the service is good and fast. I can use the tablet quickly. I like it! Support JD.com.
The screen clarity is better than the one that costs 200 yuan more. Others are pretty good. Old people watch dramas.
"I bought it for someone else. I heard it's okay, but it comes with a lot of software."
The quality is so bad! Only used it for a month! It crashed immediately! Can't open it at all!
"I've been using it for a few days and haven't had any problems yet. *You can’t ask too much for mobile phones, overall it’s okay."
"It looks pretty good, I’ll use it for a while to see how the quality is and then I’ll review it!"
Not bad. I placed the order at night and it arrived the next morning!
"Hey, Mengniu Yili has been determined not to drink for a long time, keep insisting, awesome"
"Not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad"
# Conscientious Milk# Share pictures Mengniu is very dedicated and has been producing safe milk for the 30th day
"Mengniu Zhenguoli’s milk drinks are delicious, I especially like them"
It’s okay! The response speed is quite fast.
"The stuff is very good, I am very satisfied with my shopping! The stuff is very good, I am very satisfied with my shopping!"
I bought it for an old lady. It has small games and videos that are completely stress-free. Come on Huawei!
Bought for a friend and she is very satisfied!
"Yesterday 1158 became 1148 today, I am depressed."
"OK, second time buying"
"The domestic ones still don’t work, and it’s useless to buy them. Some cards are stuck."
"If you don’t drink Mengniu, at least you won’t be miserable!"
Not bad. I gave it to my mother. She likes it.
"Huawei is a big brand. I have been using Huawei mobile phones, Huawei routers, and Huawei tablets. Only then did I realize that I am a Huawei fan."
The breakfast in the room was provided. The only thing I didn’t like was that it included the shameful Mengniu.
No headphone cable. Very bad feeling
"This is the second time I bought it for a friend, who liked it very much."
The tablet was shipped yesterday and I received it at noon today. It looks good and the screen resolution is high and very clear. I just don’t know if it will freeze after being used for a long time.
"My dear, I support Mengniu Didi, okay?"
So handsome! Oushi Mengniu is great!
The first time I use Huawei is also the last time I use it. The least I can do is touch shit.
I just bought it last night and the price is reduced today. How can I trust you in the future?
"It’s okay, and it’s smooth to use. However, the system is a wireless version for mobile phones and a wifi version for tablets. It is not a specialized system."
"I didn’t want to leave a bad review at first, but seeing as Liu QD is a fellow countryman and his hometown is very close, I really can’t bear it now."
"The size is moderate and can be expanded with a TF card. The packaging is exquisite, so it is good to show the elders a big picture."
"ridiculous. Representative of the Herds Party: There is nothing wrong with Mengniu Yili, the problem lies at the source http:t.cn/zjz2TTV (Shared from @??)"
"The delivery man is good, the quality of the tablet is average"
There is nothing except a charger. I don’t want to give it 1 star.
"It's just for listening to music and looking at pictures, and the battery is pretty good. It's still acceptable at this price!"
"Shirking responsibility, I express my disappointment! ! ! !"
"Logistics and delivery are fast, and the courier guy's service attitude is very good."
"The tablet works normally, but the charger is broken and the after-sales service cannot keep up!"
"Mengniu, you guys work so hard..."
"I am very disappointed that when I open the memory of a 32G mobile phone, it only has 23G. Why! ! And there is no Huawei headphone cable in the package! !"
"The worst shopping experience on JD.com. They actually sent me an old mobile phone. Although the after-sales service is quite good and timely, the problem of your self-operated store sending me an old mobile phone must be criticized."
"It has always supported domestically produced Huawei. The sound quality is very shocking, all functions are normal, and the operation is smooth. No problems have been found yet. JD.com logistics is super fast."
I don’t want to give it a star. I risk my life by using this phone. It gets hot while charging. It’s hot but not overheating. The after-sales service test said it’s normal. Please don’t buy this phone. Cherish your life and refuse to enjoy 6
Very bad. I just bought it and the screen always won’t click. It’s rubbish.
fraud. Junk. The card I received cannot be installed.
"It's okay, but it's a little blurry, and it's not possible to open it for inspection in front of the courier. You have to pay for it first. I'm drunk too,"
"The bad reviews are not easy to use and are very stuck. The owner of the store is stingy and doesn’t offer any gifts. The genuine products mentioned above are all lies. I received nothing, except the host computer and data cable. I advise everyone not to buy it"
"Mengniu also sells banana milk, which tastes good and not as sweet as the Korean ones."
It doesn’t feel as easy to use as Xiaomi’s tablet!
"Too scary! Halo. Compared with the 50-cent milk popsicles sold by Mengniu, which are not hygienic, this high-priced, low-quality, bad brand is even more deceptive. I will definitely not eat them again."
"The hot water gas has been installed, the after-sales service is very good, and the big brand makes people feel reassured."
"Supports domestic production, Huawei is a big brand worth buying! The smoothness is quite good!"
"Jingdong’s service is very good, and the logistics is excellent. The delivery staff always delivers to your door. The attitude is very good. I will only buy from here in the future."
Mengniu dazzling cup. It’s still delicious with blueberries @HHJ?Miss
"It's for babies. My baby likes it very much, and so does my family. The only pity is that I took the wrong picture at the time. I should have taken the tablet with a card."
"Bought this for my mother, it’s very good, my mother is very satisfied"
good. It feels good after I got it and used it.
"When you reach the bottom, no matter how you go, it is progress. When you have nothing and nothing to lose, it is precisely when you want to gain and succeed (Jack Ma). Every day is for tomorrow (Mengniu). come on!"
"Don’t drink Mengniu, let it go bankrupt"
The tragedy of China’s dairy industry: I haven’t drank Mengniu for many years!
"The speed is still very good and the system is very easy to get used to. Bought for my 3-year-old son to play with, it’s enough!"
"2 consecutive price cuts within a week, speechless"
"The goods arrived yesterday*, deceiving consumers"
Not bad! I have been using Huawei! Mobile phones too!
"I have been looking at the Huawei tablet for a long time, and finally bought it on 6.18. It is very good. It does not freeze at all when watching movies. It is very practical. The call version is better. You can use data when going out. It is convenient and easy to use. Like it!"
It is used in the company’s lottery and supports the domestic product Huawei. I will recommend it to my friends to buy it.
Jingdong is rubbish. I will never buy anything from Jingdong again. I got so many things for free after I bought them. I didn’t buy them. It’s only been a day or two. It’s strange that your business doesn’t go bankrupt if you do this. Jingdong is rubbish.
"Very good, just what I want"
"The appearance is beautiful, the product quality is very good, the service is good, and the delivery is fast."
The customer service quality of JD.com is rubbish. It is better to go to the physical store to buy.
"It’s okay, hehe, it’s worth owning, it’s cost-effective, hehe, you can buy it! Come on everyone!"
"The faint faint hesitation of hesitation, hesitating and hesitation, the spit ping ping -pong mountains and rivers, hey, hey haha"
"I feel like Mengniu old yogurt, I admire Teacher Zheng."
"It's okay to use, but the gold color isn't too true."
"This is my first time buying a mobile phone from JD.com, and it’s very good."
Mengniu is a big bully in the store. At least its attitude is better than Mengniu~~ Please make corrections in the future!
It’s just rubbish. Whoever buys it will regret it.
I think it’s pretty good and I recommend it to everyone.
Bought for my mother specifically for watching movies. Economical and fast delivery.
Huawei products still have quality assurance
"Tablet use is still good! But the problem of abnormal charging occurred only two months ago! If it is not fully charged after charging for a while, it will not be charged!"
"The tablet display is excellent, all operations are smooth, and the quality is good. A film was given as a random gift"
"The second time I bought it, I bought the accessories myself. It was a good deal. The water heater is economical and easy to use! All 5 points"
"I bought it the day before and the price was reduced by 100 the next day. I also asked customer service but no one responded, so forget it. It took 8 days for express delivery. I was really drunk. It was a very depressing shopping experience."
The price was reduced just a few days after I bought it. I called JD.com customer service. They were like rubbish. I bought so many things at my expense. The attitude of 7008 customer service is terrible.
"Jingdong is fast. I placed the order and received it today. I haven’t had time to use it yet. I’ll review it after using it. If it works well, I’d still buy one."
I bought 8 units at a time. The installer helped me install them for nearly a day and I was exhausted. The store's service attitude was very good. My invoice and magnetic card were lost by express delivery. The store promised to give me a copy of the receipt and planned to buy another one for my own home.
I’m not very satisfied. Why doesn’t it come with a tablet case and headphone cable? I feel like I want to return it. I’m just short of these two things now. Do you think there is any way to get me a pink case and headphone cable?
"Mengniu milk, godfather’s favorite"
"It fits very well and feels good in the hand! Good review! Second time buying, good"
"Shopping on JD.com is affordable ~ I accidentally bought 16 mobile phones, and I won’t have to buy any more mobile phones next time! _(: ??)_Ga?"
"It’s really not that good, it’s so rubbish, it freezes sometimes and freezes sometimes! It’s worth it! Buy with caution!"
"I have been a gold user for many years, but I am disappointed. I have been asking for an invoice for a long time, but JD.com will not give it! Angry! ! ! ! ! ! Later, I was told that the electronic invoice issued was still personal, which was depressing!"
The delivery of the tablet was very fast. I placed the order the day before yesterday and received it yesterday. My son likes it very much.
"Very average. . The camera is bad,"
"Just bought it. When I took it apart, there were such big scratches. Contact customer service. Tell me to request an exchange. . It’s too stupid to believe JD.com. . ."
"Just do some homework for the kids, watch some cartoons, and at most play on WeChat or something like that."
"A mobile phone that can also be used as a tablet, practical and affordable"
"The tablet looks good, the screen is very clear, the camera is good, and the system is running 4.0. It feels good, but the home button is a bit small and inconvenient."
The tablet looks great and is fast. I am quite satisfied! Worth recommending!
The resolution is too poor to accept and makes watching TV uncomfortable.
"Currently using it, not bad! No problem found! It’s just not fast charging"
Feels good
Why are we not allowed to inspect the goods? Why are we not allowed to inspect the goods? Why are we not allowed to inspect the goods? You must also sign for receipt and tell us to contact after-sales service if there are any problems. Is it because Jingdong explicitly stipulates this or is the express delivery unwilling to allow inspection?
"I have a few tablets to play with. To be honest, I didn’t have high expectations before I bought it. I feel really good after I got the product. One word, worth it!"
I can't turn it on after less than two months of use. What kind of machine is it self-operated?
Pretty good...it’s almost enough to buy this configuration at this price
"Ma Bi will never come to JD.com to buy anything again. What a scam. The price of the order I placed last night was reduced today, but I still can’t apply for price guarantee. Damn you Ma Bi!"
"Huawei Honor supports domestic products, good, good, good, good"
"Broken mobile phone, bought for someone else, the quality is too bad"
"The quality of the mobile phone is very good, but there is no gift."
"Jingdong’s logistics is still very fast, the tablet is very cost-effective, the system is smooth, and the dual speakers have good sound quality. It is worth buying!"
"It has been more than half a month since I received the product. It was not easy to use at first, but gradually it became easier to use. It may be a matter of habit, but the main reason is that the resolution of the screen is really good."
Feel cheated. Not true. Downloaded applications cannot be installed automatically. My mobile phone is also from Huawei. But it can be installed automatically.
"Received the goods, Huawei m3 domestic product is pretty good~"
"The picture and color are fine, but it seems to take a long time to charge."
"It looks exquisite, is fast to use, and is great for watching movies and playing games, and it also has fingerprints. Watching movies is better than rice. Kirin 950 is perfect for popping rice. Organize activities to give away things** down to 1778."
"The one star is not for this product, but because I bought the shell and film package version, why was I only given a bare machine?"
"Traditional national entrepreneurs such as Zong Qinghou, CEO of Wahaha, and Niu Gensheng of Mengniu, are all very loyal and grateful entrepreneurs..."
"The clarity is too blurry, the resolution is low, the price is high, and there is no film attached. Very bad. There are no gifts to give. The product purchased was not worth the price."
"I don’t want to post pictures anymore. There are obvious signs of disassembly on the back case. It doesn’t look like the original back case. The gap is relatively large. After using it for a while, I didn’t look good at a website and sometimes it didn’t respond."
"The smoothness is very good. After all, the running memory is 3. I added an expansion card and I am very satisfied. It is now made in China and I really feel good about it."
"I haven’t looked at it, so I don’t know yet, but the delivery person didn’t send it upstairs to me!"
"The product is very good. It is not very heavy when you hold it in your hand. It is very thin, feels good and runs smoothly."
"Except for the slightly weak pixels and the battery which is not particularly durable, I am satisfied with everything else and the price is perfect."
I have already bought 5 or 6 mobile phones on JD.com. This time I also looked at the tablet for a long time before deciding to buy it. It is quite safe to buy electronic products on JD.com!
A tablet priced around 2600 is useless without headphones. The display is blurry and the quality is not good.
"I bought it for my mother. The Wi-Fi reception signal is so poor, it’s not as good as an old phone, and the speed is also slow."
I saw Mengniu’s advertisement in the middle. It was so disgusting. Zhejiang Satellite TV was really bad.
"Watching videos is smooth, clear and detailed, easy to use, has a long continuation time, and generates little heat."
I finally installed it today and used it for a while. It can heat up very quickly. The price is good.
"Not bad, my parents use it very well"
"It’s okay to buy at the current price, but the fever is a bit serious"
"It’s okay, but why not give it a tempered film?"
Never buy Huawei as a rubbish brand
The memory is too small and the wireless network distance is too short. Others are just okay.
"I haven't received it yet, what should I do?"
I bought it last year for 1888 yuan. This year it’s only 1299 yuan. The price reduction is too fast. But it’s really good to play games.
Huawei is trustworthy and good value for money. I bought it for my son. My son is very happy.
I gave one star purely because job number 9057 has a bad attitude and is rigid.
I will review it after using it for a week. I watched the TV series and it is enough for my children to study. The 618 purchase is 200 cheaper than before. It is still a good deal. I support Huawei.
"It feels okay, no wear and tear, it should be a new machine, I will use it for a while before commenting."
"It’s just that the virtual navigation keys are hard to use, and some software doesn’t have a quality exit key."
"After using it for a week, a light yellow line appeared on the screen. I was speechless!"
"Therefore, you should have more confidence and drink more Mengniu milk!"
I don’t know why I keep jumping around on my own. This is so stupid.
"I won a lottery. Less than half a month after I bought it, the fingerprint lock suddenly failed. I couldn’t restart it N times and it didn’t work. I’m going crazy."
**My phone is so hot that I don’t dare to use it. I’m really afraid that it will explode if I use it.
"I was fooled again by JD.com, taking advantage of my lack of familiarity with JD.com’s purchasing procedures, to buy a high-priced mobile phone at 618. The store is bullying customers, disgusting! nausea! nausea!"
"Generally speaking, if you choose to use a phone card or a TF card, you must give a negative review. This setting still retains the idea of ????either using it as a tablet or a mobile phone..."
"Hey, don’t buy and drink it. Mengniu should also have a problem, should I drink it or not?"
"Not bad, good value for money"
Cell phones are OK. It was Goudong who blocked my account. So I will continue to give bad reviews until I am cleansed.
"It’s not that good either, it’s stuck and runs slowly."
"That's it. I've always used Apple's system, so I'm not used to it yet."
"The screen is not easy to stick to the mold, and there is no electronic invoice."
"Don't be cheap about Mengniu. Don't buy it even if the packaging is changed. Those who still buy Mengniu after frequent accidents, don’t be mean!"
"No invoice, no gift, not even a film"
The resolution is too poor and the picture is blurry. The photo is blurry and impossible to take. Don't buy it. It's not worth it.
"When I bought it, I thought it was 4G, but it turned out not to be the case. The Internet got stuck."
Huawei's products are still very good.
"Really, the operating experience is not as good as a mobile phone costing several hundred dollars, and domestic tablets are too rubbish. Is it better to buy an Apple tablet or Apple?"
"Average, very average"
"If I don’t like Mengniu, I won’t drink it in the future."
"The pixels of the photos may not be very high, but I am not a professional photographer, so it is enough. The screen is large, the resolution is high, and the sound effects are great! ! ! ,,Support domestic products! ! !"
"If you change the packaging and continue to harm people, are you Mengniu or Mengren? Mengniu changes its look to leather, possibly stripping away negative news http:t.cn/zlwGKu0 @Sohu News Client"
"There are slight scratches on the reflection of the frame, which looks like something that has been reassembled. I don’t know if it is a reworked product, or if it is something produced by Huawei that has a defective appearance."
"Too lazy to comment, it's too boring. The price is reduced as soon as I buy it, and I always thank you for participating in the Jingdou flop every day. It’s just a few Jingdong, is it necessary? I really want to scold JD.com"
When will Mengniu die?
"The delivery was fast and the goods were good. From the moment I opened the package, I could feel Huawei's care. The only pity is that the charging data cable is terrible."
"I tried it for a long time, and it was okay. However, the black edges were a bit too big, but as long as the quality is good, it’s worth it, and the sound isn’t too loud. I just hope it’s durable."
"It was a wise move for Mengniu to let COFCO take a stake in the company. Since it is a state-controlled company, there will be much less harassment from Yili. Of course, this also brings about the problem of declining management quality. But compared to Lao Liang, Lao Niu is much more comfortable."
"I have learned a lot again. Athletes do not drink Mengniu or Yili. This packaging is extremely simple, extremely low-key, and the brand is extremely silent. It is something that appears every day in athletes’ restaurants..."
"Trusted brand, trustworthy self-operated, this is the second T1-821w. The previous one is still very useful even after two years. The two siblings each have one, so don’t grab it."
I want to say goodbye to Huawei ~ No explanation
I really hate it when the price is reduced after buying it.
I hesitated for a long time before placing the order. I placed the order at night and it arrived the next morning. I loved it when I got it. The screen is big enough and the resolution for watching TV is very clear.
The price dropped by 200 just one day after I bought it. I’m so depressed.
This is the third time I bought it for a friend and it works great. Awesome express delivery. Like one?
"Received, I like this product very much, it is very convenient to have it delivered to my home!"
"The response is too slow, the screen is stuck, and the camera pixels are too low. It is not as good as the first-generation Redmi I bought n years ago. It also does not support OTG, cannot use USB flash drives, and cannot use external keyboards. It is too troublesome to cancel the order. Otherwise, I'll quit."
I have been using it for a long time and it feels really good. It is used for postgraduate entrance examinations. The memory is enough and there is no lag. I can take pictures of the questions in pixels and show them to others. It is clear enough. It is absolutely no problem to share the study questions.
"Overall, the phone is very good, but the workmanship of the card slot is not ideal. Why is my on/off button louder than the volume button? Are all yours like this? Thank you, let me know if you know it! In addition, the price is very satisfactory!"
It’s simply a scam to consumers. The price is reduced the day after you buy it*/I’m too lazy to return it. I don’t want to give it a single star.
"Good, good, good"
good. The quality is very good and the sound effect is also good. I give it a 5-point rating. I have been using Huawei products and this one is very cost-effective.
"As a professional, it is seriously unreasonable for Mengniu to refuse to turn around! @???"
"Good value for money, supports domestic products"
"We agreed on a shell and film set, but got a bare metal? Why, if you can’t afford it as a gift, don’t get the set version. Talk to customer service about being irresponsible? So what’s the use of your customer service?"
"The battery is bad, too stuck"
"Jingdong, I am very speechless for you! Can there be price protection? ? ? The price dropped by 200 within a few days of purchase? ? Rubbish! ! !"
"It's probably a refurbished machine. There are 11 years of video and audio in it, but none of them are included."
"I bought it for the quality of Huawei and sold it to my dad for use in his hometown. However, after using it for less than two months, it started to consume power quickly and became hot when charging. Now I am waiting to send it back to Guangzhou for after-sales inspection."
"Bad review! Too bad, the battery ran out of power after playing games for two hours."
"It's okay. It feels pretty good and the screen is just right. I'm still updating, so I don't know how effective it is. Personally, I feel that Huawei tablets are doing well among domestic manufacturers."
"After upgrading to the 7.0 system, it runs smoothly, but it seems that the power consumption is a bit fast. The screen-on time is about six hours. Overall, it’s okay!"
"Good, good, good, good"
"The screen resolution is crazy, the packaging is bad, and the usage condition is slightly worse."
"Not bad, good quality and cheap"
"I took a picture, it’s pretty good,,,,, this is the second one I bought."
"When I call, I can't receive the call, and I can't hang up. I get it only once out of ten times, and no one has answered my inquiries to customer service until now."
"I'm using it now, no problem"
Where's my giveaway? Giveaway. Are they just deceiving consumers?
"The screen is huge and it’s a pleasant surprise when it’s turned on. , the film I bought was more difficult to apply just now because the screen is too big. Because I usually use a five-inch mobile phone."
I have always trusted JD.com's products. This time I didn't give an invoice when I bought a mobile phone. I felt like I was cheated.
"I received the baby and couldn't wait to play with it for two days. It feels very good and the response is very fast. Maybe it’s a new reason! I just don’t know yet whether the battery will last or not, we won’t know until it takes a while."
The quality is good and the packaging is also very good. It supports Huawei products.
"The product has not been used yet and cannot be evaluated, but the logistics is too slow. I bought it on the 11th and picked it up on the 15th. Maybe you said it was due to Double 11, but the fact is that it cannot stand the test. I am very annoyed. Because I needed it urgently, I almost missed it. !"
The product is very good. I mainly buy it for my children to play with. I like it.
"I repeatedly checked whether it was delivered yesterday and the customer service confirmed that it would definitely be delivered. As a result, I checked that it was sent to the wrong site and I definitely couldn't get it, so I went to the site to pick it up later. The efficiency of this group of customer service really couldn’t be lower! !"
"I have been paying attention to this tablet for a long time, and bought it as soon as the price dropped. It is very good, very easy to use, and has high cost performance. Jingdong Express is very good. If you place an order in the morning, it will arrive in the afternoon. It is amazing that a small county like me can do this!"
Very good and trustworthy
"Very good, the color is clear, the operation is smooth, and there is no lag. It is proud of being made in China. The free LeTV membership is enough. You can watch VIP movies and get additional coupons."
"It took me a few days to evaluate it. Except for the pixelation, everything else is good..."
"Good, good, very good, I use it all the time! Good, good, very good, I use it all the time! Good, good, very good, I use it all the time!"
Very good service.
Things have been received. Things are good.
"Grandma, it’s so deceptive. Not only Mengniu, but also Mengren. It’s so deceptive."
"Mengniu has no conscience, don’t worry about milk! I boycott Mengniu! Pei Pei must not buy Mengniu, Tianya has already taken Mengniu out of business! mwah. I voted for the option ""303-Supreme Lihe""."
"Received, bought for dad. I hope he will become cuter as he gets older"
"I have always bought their products, they are really useful."
"Mom is so wonderful! I only drank 3 bottles of the high calcium milk I was given a few days ago! Now I’ve been given a box of Mengniu chocolate milk special worth 60 yuan! Wow wow wow! I'm so happy! Don't be envious, don't be jealous!"
"Very good, I have been using Huawei products"
"It is light, fast, responsive, and does not generate much heat after first use. It is a must-have for B-installation!"
I can't stand it. I don't know if someone else has used it or something. It automatically downloads and installs software. It keeps jumping on the screen and automatically clicks here and there. It's a very disappointing purchase.
"This is the worst shopping experience I have ever had. This is the first time I have given a negative review. The store is not wrong at all for bullying customers. I have nothing to say but can only tell other consumers to be careful! careful! There is no complaint phone number, alas! Looking forward to 315 coming soon"
"Well, everyone talks about Mengniu, but I like Guangming."
I've been using it for a while and I'm basically satisfied with it. It is more convenient and safe to buy online.
"The stuff is good. Logistics is OK, order placed in the morning and delivered at 4pm."
Just finished eating. satisfy ing. Depart for Sansu Temple. Today's trip is really good. Mengniu also distributed small gifts. The interaction is also very happy. grateful . Have a nice weekend.
"The packaging is pretty good. The tablet is beautiful and runs smoothly. Logistics is very fast, no defects."
The price dropped just one day after purchasing it* Are you kidding me?
I've been using it for about half a year and now it's scrapped? It's not very durable.
The price will be reduced within a few days of receiving it! There is something wrong with the handset. I won’t replace it. It’s a broken thing!
"We must ensure that we give the best to our international friends and compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and leave the worst to our invulnerable ""own people."" Mengniu is really just Mengniu, not Mengren any more!"
"JD.com is good for fast delivery, but it would be even better if they provide a protective case!"
The water heater has been installed. It looks beautiful. I hope it will last a long time.
"Send nothing, bad review"
"Damn it, lawlessness, boycott Mengniu, start with me! ! Repost Weibo"
"Less than half a month after I bought it, the price dropped*...it's so annoying! ! !"
I was surprised when I got it. It's big and beautiful. I believe it.
My phone is not charging. It was my first time to go to JD.com to sell my phone and it started to go wrong less than a month ago. I was so lucky that JD.com sent me a fake product. The key is that I still don’t know who to call to deal with it. I hate you so much JD.com.
"An unpleasant online shopping experience,"
"Is this the quality of Huawei’s mobile phones? This call function does not work properly. It’s quite depressing, and it’s a reference for other people who want to buy, so be careful! All you lose is your hard-earned money."
"Very good, my baby likes it"
Today I specially took a photo in the early morning. The price is the same as the previous few days. I haven’t received the goods yet. Now I’m getting a protective case for free. I’m angry. The machine runs a little lag and the picture is a little unclear. Bad review.
This one from Mengniu is great!
"JD customer service, please take a look. Although Huawei's tablet is not expensive, it is still an electronic product. Do you think this kind of packaging can withstand the bumps of the journey and being thrown around by loaders?"
Received the goods today - I really like the high quality and low price. A great value for money purchase!
Very good phone. . Express delivery is very fast
"Large screen, no pressure to hold with one hand. The battery is very powerful!"
"I like Mengniu’s new packaging very much. It feels much more upscale, concise, and the main elements of expression are also very clear! Don’t be surprised that “design must withstand the changes of the times”!"
"The phone responds slowly and the earpiece sound is very low. Just make do with it after buying it. Not long after, the price was reduced by 400. I feel that I have been cheated. Bad review. This is the first time I buy something on JD.com. It’s really bad!"
"I have been using it for less than half a month, and it has not fallen. It comes with a case and a tempered film. The glass under the screen is cracked. I cannot praise the quality! Hope it's just a case! !"
Resolution is too poor
"The machine is great, smooth and beautiful. It is really worth buying. It’s also good for children to study"
It’s rubbish. Don’t buy it.
"It’s okay to play Honor of Kings, I specially chose the same ratio as the mobile phone screen! Special effects are fully enabled without lag! Although the screen is a bit big, I can use it because my fingers are not short! Is it not recommended for people with short fingers to use this product when playing with pesticides?"
"Haha, you bought it second-hand, and you treat consumers like this?"
"The tablet is very beautiful, the quality is good, the system is smooth, and it’s great to use!"
My heart is dedicated to logistics. Cell phones are as bad as they are bad. Something went wrong half a day after I bought it. WiFi cannot be turned on. Even restoring to factory settings won't work. I doubt it was refurbished.
"The memory card slot does not match the memory card. The card cannot come out after being put in. Even after changing the card three times, it still does not work. After-sales service said that you should refund some money and buy a memory card yourself. However, the money was not refunded and the card was not replaced. Jingdong shopping failed. ,"
It's still a good deal at this price. Huawei's quality is still good. I'm satisfied.
"Just focus on the screen ratio. The system is rubbish, it is better to buy Xiaomi."
It’s too laggy and the resolution is too low. It’s even more rubbish than a mobile phone.
VIP membership card can’t be used. I’m so angry.
The logistics is fast and the price is good. But the price was reduced after I just bought it.
very good product
"What a rubbish phone, I regret it so much"
"Very satisfied, a better shopping"
"Mengniu is very sincere. They hold activities in front of the gym in the middle of winter. If you repost this post on Weibo, you will receive five boxes of yogurt. But I see men, women, old and young in the gym with their hands on their breasts and milk foam spitting out from the corners of their mouths@The Mottled Life"
"The quality of this product is very good, the screen is clear, and it can make calls. It is suitable for the elderly. The logistics is also fast. Good reviews."
"With this kind of packaging, I'm afraid that the tablet will be broken. Apart from the packaging, everything else is pretty good. I haven't found any problems. I'll add more later."
"Great, very smooth and no lag, the photo effect is good, praise!"
"First time purchase, okay?"
The mobile phone is not as good as expected
"It was bent when I got it, and the packaging was just a plastic bag wrapped in a box. I give you the first bad review."
"The workmanship is great, the screen is very clear, the speed is fast, and there is no lag, which is very good."
The screen feels hollow. Is it a fake? There is no invoice
The delivery was fast and it was in time for the event. It was pretty good.
Mengniu go to hell
The sound is low and the picture quality is poor. Really don’t recommend buying it
"It feels good to use, and the system games are relatively smooth. The actual available memory is about 6g... add a memory card, and the battery will last about six hours for watching movies. This is a new machine."
"The phone is good, it plays games quickly, and it feels good to watch movies. JD.com’s logistics speed is super fast, and the delivery person’s service attitude is first-class?"
"1600 Such a big phone tablet, okay, okay"
When will my invoice be given to me? ? ? ? ? ? Bad service!
Stay away from Mengniu!
The most disgusting purchase ever
"The Huawei tablet is great. It supports domestic production, runs fast, and has no problem playing games. Thumbs up for China, and thumbs up for China. Come on. ."
"Damn it, I will definitely not buy cut cakes anymore, boycott it, boycott it completely! Boycott it just like you boycotted Mengniu Shuanghui!"
"Not good, average"
"Jingdong is so efficient! I bought it the afternoon before and it arrived the next morning, very timely! The screen of the mobile phone is larger than expected, and the children can’t put it down! Not bad!"
Jingdong is shameless and sells repaired goods
Mengniu is producing milk for us. Really touched! ! !
"Slow arrival, poor service"
"The screen is big enough and very clear, which is enough for daily surfing and watching videos. The battery life is great and can last for several days without charging. The price is a bit deceptive, and there was a special offer right after I bought it."
I’ve already blacklisted Y! It’s been a long time since I bought junk Mengniu.
"Good reviews, the screen display is good, and the performance is enough for the elderly."
The price/performance ratio is very high and I always trust Huawei. Hope it lasts.
Wifi network is unstable and rubbish
"My brother bought it, he said it was good"
"Two x1 and two x2, both did not disappoint. The battery is awesome. Isn’t there an x3 coming later?"
"Yes, big screen, clear. I bought it at around ten o'clock the night before. It was delivered by express delivery early the next morning. It's good."
The quality is really good
The price/performance ratio is relatively high. The only regret is the serious black edges.
"It's a bit silly, it's a pity that I keep using it this time"
"A few days after I bought it, the price was reduced by 200, which was very unpleasant. I originally bought it for an event, thinking it was a discount, but within a few days of purchase it dropped to 200 RMB less than the event price. That's right..."
It’s a domestically produced product. I’m quite satisfied with it. It’s top-notch in terms of brightness and shape. I don’t play games and I don’t know how smooth the game is. The WiFi version I bought can’t make calls.
"It's okay to use, I really like it, but the screen resolution is not very high."
"The logistics is fast, the courier's service attitude is good, and the tablet feels good after using it"
It's not bad. It's pretty good to use. It's just that the Huawei tablet doesn't have many accessories.
Not as good as before
It's a very good thing. It has a big screen and fast speed. It can make calls and install memory cards. It's suitable for entertainment. I'm very satisfied.
No memory card sent! Bad review!
"A gift for my dad. He uses it very well, but sometimes it has some glitches."
"I’m not satisfied at all. I originally trusted JD.com, but after using the product for just one day, it keeps freezing up. When I asked for after-sales service, no one paid attention to it. I guess I will never buy anything from JD.com again. It’s too troublesome to deal with after-sales service."
"Just in time to watch! Huawei's products are flashy and you can do whatever you want! It’s not cost-effective and looks good! It’s really worth it! Everyone, please stop buying it! It’s really good!"
"The workmanship is excellent. It feels good in hand. However, when setting the font size, the screen repeatedly freezes. You need to turn off the screen and restart it. I don’t know if it’s a setting problem or a system problem. Overall, a good value for money board."
This is the first time I heard that they don’t provide headphones. No wonder Huawei’s brand value is not as good as Apple’s. This is the last time I buy Huawei.
"First time eating ice cream in Nanjing. Mengniu's ""Suibian"" is delicious. I am here: #???, Nanjing City, Gulou District, Zhongshan Road # I am at: http:t.cn/zjUOpYH"
It's okay. It's not bad after using it for a while.
It’s very easy to use. I use it as a tablet all the time.
I hate Mengniu. I won’t buy Mengniu anymore.
"The price dropped as soon as I bought it, and it was a flash sale. JD.com is becoming more and more fake."
"The camera was broken, so I took it to replace the camera. It was for the Huawei brand. I didn’t expect that this kind of product could still leave the factory."
I have always trusted JD.com for electronic products. The order I placed last night arrived at noon. It was fast. I will add comments after using it later!
"What? The price dropped less than a week after I bought it. I asked customer service to apply for a quote. When I asked again, there was no response."
"There is nothing wrong with Mengniu Yili, only those who drink it have something wrong..."
"The stuff is good, the price is cool, I like it, I will recommend buying it"
The screen is broken and I don’t want to say anything.
"# stock market - foreign exchange market - futures market - Chinese people's memory is so bad that companies like Yili, Mengniu and Shuanghui should be shut down. The same goes for all liquor stocks now, which are worthless."
I've been using it for a few days and the price is pretty good.
"There are scratches in the middle of the film, and the film does not match the flat plate. The film is longer than the flat plate."
"The workmanship is very good and the software is also very fast to create pills. Overall, I am very satisfied."
"During this period, customer service called me twice, including once at almost 11 o'clock in the evening, begging me to change the return to an exchange."
"Not bad, suitable size, fast, good reviews!"
The purchasing experience this time was very poor on JD.com!
"I bought it during a discount, the quality is good, and it is convenient for reading books and watching videos."
I bought this Huawei tablet and now I don’t have to carry a computer on my back.
"Hey, it’s a bare metal! Give it a try and feel it!"
"The screen was cracked, but the customer service said they signed for it and ignored it."
"Fortunately, it's a bit stuck, and I bought it for the elderly at home. It's useful, reasonably priced, and durable. My family chooses Huawei for all their phones and tablets. Support domestic production!"
"It's a very good tablet. I only want to watch movies and novels, but not play games. This configuration is more than enough."
"It’s not easy to use. The screen often flickers. I wanted to return it, but unfortunately I can’t find the original box. I’m very depressed."
"Herdsmen representative: There is nothing wrong with Mengniu Yili, because those who have problems are milk drinkers"
I bought it for my nephew to play games with. It’s very powerful and good.
"The quality, feel, and colors are all good~~ worth buying..."
"Received, haven't used it yet, it is genuine, I will review it later."
It's a very nice tablet.
"Resolutely boycott Mengniu! I will never drink Mengniu! I also advise people around me not to drink or buy. Since the melamine incident, the whole family has been notified to ban the purchase of all Mengniu products. Is there any justice for Mengniu not to go bankrupt?"
Huite Mengniu is still very good~ I’ll come back next time@jingforget-you-cao
"In the past, there was a list of receipts for those who did not need to be reimbursed. This time, there was nothing for reimbursement. The customer service staff could not find it. It was annoying."
Anything is fine. It’s just a bit frustrating to be downgraded right after I bought it.
"Except for the poor screen, everything else is fine"
Huawei quality passes the test
"The express delivery is too slow, the service attitude is poor, the baby is okay,,,,,"
"Very good, the stuff is very good"
"The clarity is relatively high and the size is quite satisfactory. Well, the overall price/performance ratio is pretty good."
Mengniu’s new packaging is so refreshing! !
"How should I put it? Kakaka, and the price was reduced as soon as I bought it. I’m speechless."
"The tablet is not very good, I feel there is something wrong with the system, and the packaging is too poor. It is just a box, placed directly inside without any protection measures, and I have been using it for a few days. Power consumption is very fast, it won’t last half a day"
"I took it back and used it for two weeks, but I feel the difference is too big. After all, it costs 800. I played a mobile game and the screen stopped moving halfway through. I had to close the screen and unlock it again, and I almost had the urge to drop it."
Why do installed apps always crash? ? ? How to deal with it? What is the problem with the mobile phone?
"Everything else is okay, but the camera is so bad that it can't be compared with the mobile phones from a few years ago."
"After using it for a period of time, I came back to evaluate it. It’s very good. The price/performance ratio is really high."
"I selected the wrong invoice and clicked on it to get an electronic invoice. I wanted to change it to a paper invoice, but they refused to change it. The service attitude was poor and I gave you a bad review~!"
Have some fun if you have time. Watching a movie should be fun
It's still good to use
"It's very good, very practical, and my family likes it very much. My house is using solar energy to replace the water heater. The process is quite troublesome, and the logistics is very complicated. It was actually carried up to the fifth floor. It's good to have a good wind, haha"
"Reply From tangible management to intangible management, from hard management to soft management, from focusing on means to grasping concepts, this is the way to develop management. I look forward to and believe that the management of Mengniu Group can reach a new level!"
"Well enough. After all, the price is there."
Is the thicker plastic film the tempered glass film?
"Although I am also very angry and have not bought Mengniu for a long time. But I have to think that without Mengniu and leaving the Yili family alone, there will probably be no good results."
Boycott Mengniu.
"After drinking Mengniu, everything will be smooth sailing."
I like Mengniu + Nestlé. Which one is your favorite?
"Good quality! Clean as always! Mr. Lei, there is no way you can compare with him!"
"It’s very well said and appreciated: learn Mengniu culture – treat every cow well, they are all mothers."
"A bottle of Mengniu Youyi C after a meal, full of nutrition and health..."
"Very good, produced on May 4th, the sound effect is as legendary, the heat dissipation is also very good, and it runs smoothly."
I’ve only been playing King of Kings for a few days and it started to get stuck. Bad review.
"The resolution is very low, and some pictures in the news cannot be seen clearly. The machine is very heavy, and one hand becomes tired after holding it for a while, and it freezes when playing high-definition videos."
"It pisses me off. When I play the Honor of Kings card on my mobile phone, I get the same answer when asked how to deal with it. It’s really not as good as Xiaomi. Huawei’s mobile phones are so good. If it’s really not that good at making tablets, let’s just get your mobile phone."
"I'm used to good reviews. If you're not satisfied after using it, you'll leave additional comments."
Mengniu's employment system: those with virtue and talent will be reused in an exceptional manner (top quality); those with virtue but without talent will be trained and used (semi-finished products); those without virtue and talent will be restricted in use (drugs); those without virtue and talent will be reused (waste products)@ Lu Haifeng
"The speed is okay, but it’s too unauthentic. I didn’t give away any gifts."
A good tablet that supports domestic production.
"The price dropped within a few days of buying it, I was speechless."
"Buy again, good review! ! !"
"Arrived quickly, will review after using it."
"What a scam. They said it runs on 3G. When the phone arrived, I saw that it only had 2G of running memory. It was really heartless."
Mengniu is good
The speed is too slow and it’s still 2G
"The mobile phone did not achieve the expected results. It doesn't feel very good when used, but I don't know what will happen next? The store was so stingy that they didn’t even bring a film or phone case. well!"
"Fast Internet speed, clear screen, smooth system"
"It's okay, the smoothness is average, sometimes the machine freezes"
"How could a company like Mengniu not collapse? Niu Gensheng said very arrogantly, ""I don't have enough official addiction, rub it!"" When the moon is full, it will be in loss..."
It’s a good choice. It’s my first time to buy a tablet. The delivery speed is very fast. I’m posting pictures in a few days.
"It’s been a great use, and I’ve given you a lot of gifts!"
"Logistics is fast, the machine is good"
"First of all, the tablet does not support Telecom’s 4G calls and failed. Secondly, the screen is a bit yellow and the things are average. I have an Apple Ipad and compared it. The two are not on the same level. I suggest high-end pursuers, don’t buy it, you will regret it."
"Boycott Japanese goods, boycott Mengniu and Yili"
A big tablet is great! It’s very convenient for the elderly to use!
"When playing music, one speaker does not sound. . Although it has been many days since I bought this. Ask for a replacement"
"Everything is good, except when I bought it, it was said that it was 1,199 yuan and the price was reduced to 998 yuan for a limited time, so I placed the order immediately! But after the time passed, it was still 998 yuan. I even suspected that this was a trick."
"Less than a week after purchasing, the price dropped by more than 100, and the customer service service did not reply~~The worst shopping experience~~~"
"1499. Just half a day after the purchase, Jingdong reduced the price by 100 on 11.11. It was promised that it would be Double 11 every day from 1 to 12."
"It's so rubbish, the resolution is so bad, it was said to be a gift of four pieces, but I received only three pieces without memory cards, I asked customer service to ask for them, but it turned out that I didn't read them clearly when I placed the order, it was a scam."
"The packaging has obviously been dismantled and it should be a return machine. You will only know the quality after using it. If there is any problem, return it immediately."
"Not ideal, the screen is not clear, I bought it for my daughter, it was a waste if I bought the wrong one"
Cheap and good quality. The stuff is pretty good and cheap. Things are pretty good
"It was the first time I bought a mobile phone on JD.com and I was very disappointed. I couldn’t use it at all within a few days after I bought it. When the phone was turned on, I often couldn’t make calls to others. It was a parallel import. Please be careful when buying it."
"I traded in the old one and bought it again. It used to be the same model, but now I have replaced it with the phone version, which supports domestic products."
"The quality of Huawei tablets is guaranteed, and they are not laggy at all when used."
The 66666 has a large screen and is comfortable for watching videos. Thumbs up
I have used it for a while to evaluate it. It is no worse than foreign mobile phones. It supports domestically produced mobile phones.
Why is there no invoice? ? The phone leaks a lot of light
"A very good tablet, the workmanship and product design are very good, especially the sound quality is excellent!"
"After only using it for a few days, my phone started to freeze a lot. I really don’t want to say it anymore. This is the first time I encountered this kind of problem. I will never buy anything on JD.com again."
Baby likes it very much. I will comment after using it. It is very enjoyable whether playing games or watching TV.
"I have been using this tablet for a month before reviewing it. very good! The sound quality is good! It just gets stuck occasionally, maybe because there are too many things installed! Overall it's pretty good."
Share the picture. Mengniuguan nourishes milk every day to enhance the body's immunity! @???
"Mengniu wants to cure cancer, Leonardo da Vinci wants to fake it, Kingsoft wants to leak secrets, but Siemens has forgotten about it. Known as the Four Poisons"
"I bought it for my mother, but the price was reduced right after I bought it, and the installment plan is interest-free. I’m so angry. Even when I asked customer service, they didn’t give me an explanation."
"I just got it at noon and found out that the price had been reduced in the evening and there was no price protection. The products that have been reduced in price also have the same gifts, so why are you talking about the gifts?"
"Just like Mengniu, strong Chinese. ."
"Delivery is too slow, resolution is disappointing"
It's bad. It's like this after falling from a height of 50 centimeters.
No big gift package! ! ! Liar
"To be honest, I just bought one to play games, and I’m very disappointed. It’s rubbish and has too many lags. It’s laggy even if I don’t do anything. It comes with too many software."
Things received! Just like imagination. Not disappointed! Still experiencing it! Will comment later! Thumbs up for logistics!
"The price went up after I bought it. It was worth buying, but there was a slight discount and they didn’t even come with a condom!"
"Overall it’s not bad, enough watching the video"
It’s still okay after using it for so long now
"The camera is okay, the response is not bad"
Tencent Video membership cannot be used. I contacted customer service and asked to check and solve the problem. It suddenly disappeared within an hour of solving the problem. Does Huawei still have customer service that does this? Really drunk
"Used in the company's workshop, they have been repurchased many times and are worth buying."
Total 5 points. Good product. I am also responsible for the installation. I have already made an appointment with the local installer.
"To be honest, this is really a scam. It only took a few days for the screen to freeze. I took it for repairs twice and it was still the same both times. I feel like giving 1 star is too much. They even said that it is self-operated by JD.com, which is a scam."
"It's okay for children to play with, but adults shouldn't buy it. The price is outrageous. . ."
"I only bought it a few days ago, and I got a note like this. The quality is not good, and I’m a little disappointed. I won’t buy it next time."
Cheap! Easy to use! It’s just a bit heavy! Show off my baby! The condom is purchased separately! Very nice!
"Turn off the phone while charging and watching, charging is super slow. 5% charge in one hour! One star for the courier guy"
There is a problem with the quality. It freezes when I use it. I won’t buy it after the back cover cracks.
"Okay, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good, very good Very good, very good, very good, very good"
"Very good, a Mother’s Day gift for my mother~she likes it very much~~~"
I no longer drink milk. I no longer buy Mengniu. Is there anyone who buys Mengniu? !
"Bad review, I don’t want to say more, more words will make me cry"
Very dissatisfied!
The quality is very poor and has been repaired. All the keys are not as responsive as Xiaomi!
"I bought it for my father. It’s convenient and easy to show off to everyone. Recently, it’s in the name of the people."
The system is smooth. I bought it specifically to play games. Onmyoji runs without any stress.
It works well and is acceptable for the price. It is a conscientious product and worth recommending
"Everything else is good, but the customer service is pushing me back and forth, which is the worst experience. They didn't even issue me a paper invoice. This is my first bad review! ! !"
"I'll go, it's too big! Awesome! Diaosi men’s clothing 13 artifacts"
Unscrupulous dairy companies like Mengniu and Yili are becoming more and more rampant.
"Very good, very good,"
"The sound quality is good, the colors are good, and it runs smoothly, but the battery power drops too quickly."
"Yeah, CCTV Mengniu is so stupid. Yeah, CCTV Mengniu is harming others and itself. Since I voted for Mengniu and switched to CCTV, my waist is no longer sore and my legs are no longer hurting. Hey! I went up to the fifth floor in one breath and I’m not tired anymore! 233"
It's okay. It's more convenient to carry around. It's actually just a mobile phone with a larger screen. It's useless.
The quality of the product is very good. It is convenient and fast to use. It is also very beautiful and compact. It is also easy to use with hot water. I am very satisfied with this product. Very suitable for home use
I bought it for playing games and watching movies. Overall it’s a good device. It’s an unopened phone and it supports JD.com. It’s great.
"No matter what, treat yourself well. (This is my favorite Mengniu pure milk)"
"JD.com is super fast, and when I use it, it feels like a big-screen phone."
The phone is not bad and the price is affordable.
"Junk Jingdong, I Tiao cannot protect price, rogue terms!"
This is also the second Huawei product I bought for a friend. The quality is very good and the price is reasonable. I recommend it.
Chairman of COFCO: The market will not forgive Mengniu if it has quality problems again. Full text: http:t.cn/zj2mwFp (Shared from @Wind Information)
"I just received it today. I feel that the screen ratio is not very coordinated. Personally, I will comment in detail after playing it for a few days!"
Good quality and low price. Support domestic products. Support Huawei. Very suitable for children to learn.
"Although it is a simple decoration, who owns the factory film for the mobile phone screen? The phone I just got gets hot after installing the software! It also automatically restarts once! Please give Jingdong a satisfactory explanation for these issues!"
I also like Mengniu milk
"Used it for two months, very good. Suitable for daily use, the battery is durable"
"Very good, I like it very much"
The goods are good and shipped quickly. I look forward to continuing to cooperate! ! ! ! ! !
"It’s necessary, the new Mengniu will set sail for happiness together. It’s here, it’s finally here!"
Isn’t it said that JD.com’s self-operated products all carry invoices?
"A very unpleasant shopping experience. They offered a free leather case while supplies last. However, I haven’t received the leather case yet. I want to know if anyone has received the leather case? Disgusting activity!"
"It looks good and is smooth to use, but the camera has poor pixels! It's a pity that it doesn't come with headphones"
"The water heater is very good. This is the second time I shop with them. The service attitude is also very good and the logistics is fast. If you need it next time, come here again"
Not enough memory
"It feels very easy to use, but the screen is a bit small and sometimes the touch is not very sensitive. It has some lag when I first started using it, but I bought it for an event. The price is good and it's okay."
Drinking Mengniu Future Star helps me grow happily
"Mengniu's packaging has become very simple. The previous honors and exemptions from inspections have all disappeared. I hope it can do a good job in quality and branding, and there is really no additives!"
"How abominable! But I never drink Mengniu or Yili! Weiji and I! Calling for a national boycott of Mengniu ""Mengniu’s response to expired milk without apology is questioned"" (from http:t.cn/zWnxfcG"
"It's a very good tablet computer. It looks beautiful, runs fast, and has a delicate screen. I'm very satisfied with it."
Some cards are not very useful
Where is the screen protector mentioned? There is nothing inside except a bare metal. Is this considered cheating?
"All I need is a machine and nothing, not even an invoice. It’s terrible."
"Not bad, fast delivery, easy to use, support"
I just bought it and it’s pretty good so far. I can look forward to it and look forward to Onmyoji ~
It is very comfortable to watch TV and movies.
The tablet is so laggy that I can’t play several small games.
"Sincerely, I ran out of power after watching two movies. When the screen is pulled down, I always click it myself. I’m convinced."
"Low resolution, regret, feeling useless"
"After using it for about a month, I had a blue screen and the machine stuck several times. It originally supported domestic products, but I didn’t expect it. . . ."
"Not bad, not bad"
"Mosaics appear on the screen when watching TV, which is really disappointing, and the touch screen is not accurate..."
It’s a great value for the price and the sound effects are great.
"Scammer, the goods have not been received and the payment has not been made. The merchant has committed serious fraud and has reported it to the police."
"Even with the wireless network, the network speed is not as fast as the mobile phone, and the operation is not very smooth."
"For most friends who don’t smoke or drink Mengniu, this lesson is not to eat overnight dishes."
"The so-called gifts are all lies, just a charging head and a data cable"
"I pressed the button to turn off the phone, but the volume came up. I will never buy it again."
The baby has been received! ! ! ! It feels okay! ! ! I just don’t know how long it will last! ! !
"The design of the charging interface is strange, with a thin flat end. My son broke the plug in less than a month, and now he is waiting to find time to send it for repair. I really want to ask which 13th engineer designed this charging interface?"
Bought for someone. This model is my fifth. It is widely loved by middle-aged women.
"It’s been less than a month since I bought it, and my phone is getting hot and draining battery very quickly. It even burned my SIM card. FUCK!"
"After shopping for a long time, I decided to buy Huawei. After all, domestic products are considered top-notch. The delivery speed is very fast, and I am very satisfied with the touch experience, screen and thickness. I'm still trying out the specific use, but overall I'm very satisfied!"
"I’ll review it after using it for a few days. Overall, it is very good. The system is very smooth and the fingerprint unlocking speed is also very fast. I give it a five-star rating~"
"The screen is large enough, suitable for the elderly."
It’s rubbish. It’s only been half a month. It shuts down as soon as I turn it on. It’s still a bit laggy when playing King of Kings. Huawei still can’t do it.
"Bought for children to study, overall good. It feels like the gap with Apple is getting smaller and smaller. Come on Huawei~"
Too bad they didn’t get a protective cover
"Uses well, performs well, and has a big screen"
"It’s so disgusting, I don’t even have headphones, it’s not good at all"
"It's very good, the price is right, and it's great for my son to play with."
"The express delivery is fast, the quality is okay, overall it’s ok."
"Very good, I like it very much, the price is not expensive"
Huawei's workmanship can still be trusted. This is my second Huawei device this year. It looks good and is better than the Samsung 7-inch I bought at the time. I feel comfortable holding it in my hand. Continue to experience the system and equipment.
"It’s great, many classmates use this, hahaha"
The quality of the mobile phone is very good. I believe that Huawei mobile phones should last for a long time.
"It's very convenient to use. I bought it for the second time, but it was too small at the time. Authentic."
Been using it well.
"Mengniu. . . Tragedy, I was originally sleepy, but when I smiled, I was delayed."
My dad likes it very much. It’s great to watch his spy dramas. It’s also great to be able to make phone calls. I’ve been using it for a few days and there’s nothing wrong with it.
"I have been using it for more than a month. The quality of the tablet is very good. It supports domestic products. Abandon those foreign brands that sell kidneys but also buy XX. If you buy it again, it will be Huawei!"
"After drinking Mengniu's yogurt, I felt sick to my stomach and vomited -_-||I despise Mengniu! resist! @ Tangheng0805"
The new campus supermarket sells Mengniu tainted milk. Please don’t buy it! Please help! @xiehahahaha
"The quality is really not good, it's very stuck, and you can't watch high-definition videos at all."
Why is the delivery so slow? It takes 5 days.
"If you are just short of money, buy this, otherwise don’t buy it, the speed is slow and the screen definition is poor."
"Jingdong falsely advertised a promotion with a flash sale price, but the flash sale price turned out to be more expensive than the normal selling price! ! ! !"
It’s great. It has strong decoding capabilities. It can play anything. It suits me very well. The viewing effect is excellent. The battery is also large.
The shell is a bit loose and the quality is poor
Wuyu just couldn’t buy it and the price dropped by 50 yuan in one day.
"The tablet is very good. I bought it together (not as a gift). The cover came off in less than a month, cracked at the corners, and the shelf life is only seven days. The customer service said that they will leave it alone after seven days!"
"If you want to be strong, drink Mengniu. The bodybuilding boy born in the 2000s is so scary. Mengniu NULL-1, this kid is going to be incredible! The muscles are extremely developed, and the eyes are menacing and full of murderous intent."
"Very easy to use, fast delivery, very smooth to use. Good reviews"
"I bought it for my wife to watch TV, why can’t I download Honor of Kings?"
It's quite smooth to use. Worth the price.
"It's very easy to use. It can be said that at this price, you can buy this level of configuration. It's really good quality and cheap. Domestic companies that have entered the world's top 500 must be trustworthy."
"Already using it, I can’t say enough about Huawei’s quality."
"Good thumbs up, thumbs up, thumbs up"
But I firmly believe that it and M Ji will remain as strong as Mengniu and Yili. I can only rely on my own perseverance and help less~
I only reviewed it after using it for a while. It is very good. There are no problems so far. It is a very pleasant shopping.
"The tablet is very good. I have always trusted Huawei, and it didn’t disappoint me this time. It’s no worse than the ones from Guoguo! Support domestic production! This m3 does not have a Huawei VIP card, Huawei should explain this first!"
I bought one myself. My colleagues liked it and bought it while it was cheap.
It’s a rubbish computer. I hope no one will buy it. I bought it a month ago and repaired it for a month. Now my stuff has been lost. I can’t understand it.
"The machine is okay, but it gets a little hot when charging. The running speed is okay. Overall, it's okay."
"The ""Comprehensive Ability in Communication Majors (Intermediate)"" I purchased was obviously a paper book, but it turned out to be electronic. From the purchase page, it deceived and misled consumers."
"The tablet was also bent, and I was disappointed to reach it at once!"
"There's only half a cup of milk left in the refrigerator. I'm not full. What should I do? It doesn’t matter, just add half a cup of water and it will be a full cup! Don't marvel at my wisdom, I'm just standing on the shoulders of the giant Mengniu."
"It's super bad. I asked for molds and shells, but the results were gone. I communicated for a long time and didn't solve it. They tried to blame each other and got two results at the same time. I was so angry and the customer service didn't solve it. If I had known about it, I wouldn't have bought it on JD.com."
"The size is suitable, the screen is clear, the whole body is made of metal, and the performance is strong. The key is that it is domestically produced and has high cost performance."
"Ha ha. Not bad, not bad. Little Mengniu is getting more and more talented"
"Very satisfied, runs smoothly! Like, like, like"
"Very useful, like it"
Not bad! good! children like it very much
"# Mengniu tampering with product production period# Today’s profiteers are too heartless, and the government’s supervision is weak and they are complicit."
"No, the ball is stuck"
"Is it really good? Haha, Kirin 950 is also good, I’m satisfied."
"After using it for half a month, it’s terrible! The resolution is too low and it often freezes!"
Wise choice!
"It looks okay, but I don’t know if it works. The delivery was too slow. It took a week to get it after placing the order."
"The screen resolution is too low. When watching TV and browsing Moments, it is not clear and has a strong grainy feel. The photos are also blurry. The tablet is not stuck when used. The 5V1A charger takes more than 4 hours to fully charge, so the price/performance ratio is not high."
"Milk is more troublesome. You can’t afford the imported ones, and Mengniu and Yili don’t dare to drink them. If you choose Sanyuan, you have to be careful to choose the ones produced in Beijing, because you will accidentally buy the ones produced in Uehara Sanlu."
"Why is it that the English version is displayed when I open it after I buy it, but I can’t adjust it back to Chinese? What should I do?"
"Received, the delivery speed is very fast"
"Not bad, but I regret not buying it at the best price."
This product is very good. It is the most cost-effective on the market and has a long standby time.
"I bought a box of Mengniu pure milk and changed the packaging. It feels pretty good, but the amount of milk in each bag is less, about 20 to 30 ml less. I really can’t afford the increase in prices~"
Boycott Mengniu and don’t fly Air China. (Although I don’t have money to sit now) @???
"Yes, the delivery speed is very fast, the logistics is very powerful, the quality of the goods is very good, the service attitude of Jingdong Mall is very good, yes, the goods are high quality and low price, Jingdong Mall has always been my shopping choice!"
I regretted it after buying it! Rubbish
The pixels are extremely blurry. The resolution is low and about the same as 500 or 600
Not bad. . . . .
I think it's okay. I'll come back to review it when I get the chance. I got nine gigabytes of space.
"I waited a few days for the product to arrive. I finally received it today. I am very satisfied. The system is smooth, easy to operate, fast, and the protective case is also good. It looks good."
It's just like that. It costs more than a thousand. I bought it for the elderly at home to watch TV series.
what is going on? Doesn’t the model number show Huawei P9?
The order was placed at 10 o'clock the night before and the price was reduced the next morning. The application to cancel the order was not accepted. The price was directly changed and the goods were received. The next morning it was reduced to *. You are really good at Jingdong. It would be strange if you come back again.
"It's okay, but it's easy to be controlled. I had to clear it several times before I got out of control."
"I really can’t do it. It’s too laggy to watch movies and it crashes directly. After installing a few softwares, it freezes all the time."
Like? Nice shopping.
"It's great, the price/performance ratio is very good and I must give it a thumbs up."
Yili’s Miyitian is a blatant plagiarism from Mengniu Youyi C
"Don’t drink Mengniu, drink Yili. Drinking high calcium and low fat will make you lose weight painfully."
Restoring to factory settings still the same. Drunk. It keeps popping up while playing.
"There is a problem with the camera of the product being black and white for a while, but it’s okay at this price. I wanted to exchange the product at first, but the process was very slow and the service attitude was very poor. I haven’t bought anything on JD.com for a long time, so once is enough!"
"It’s true. When you buy JD.com, what you buy is quality. What you buy is service. The after-sales service is incomparable."
My tablet keeps showing up with a black screen since I bought it!
"Permanent Blocking Regulations: I swear that I will never spend money on JD.com again in my lifetime, boycott online consumption in an all-round way, and gradually cancel and unsubscribe from broadband services within 3 years. One consumption triggers a war."
"Bad review, the express delivery didn’t even include bubble wrap. Where was the 32G memory mentioned when I bought it? Fool me, rubbish merchant"
"Bought for a friend, cheap, haha"
"The two packages were put together, and there were only two packages when they were delivered. As a result, they thought they were two products when they were harvested, and they had a bad attitude when communicating."
not bad
The sound quality is unsatisfactory and the logistics and delivery are not good. One star will be deducted.
"Mengniu should go bankrupt, it’s an unscrupulous enterprise"
"The resolution of this screen is really not good. It hurts my eyes when I look at it. The rest is okay, but I don’t dare to use it for a long time."
"I don’t want to complain about the logistics. Although it is an electronic product, it doesn’t take half a month to ship it. I have to call customer service every day to push it, and the attitude is extremely bad."
"It's good, it looks simple and elegant, and it heats up pretty quickly if the temperature isn't set too high. The store and after-sales service are very good. The store replaced one for me because it leaked before, so I recommended that my sister buy one too."
The pixels are very low and damaged.
"I received it very quickly. It arrived in two days. It was said that it was delivered, but why did I ask myself to pick it up? I bought it for a relative and haven't installed it yet. I bought one before and it worked well. I can trust it for the second time."
"Very good, I always trust JD.com’s self-operated products"
"May I ask the representative, there is nothing wrong with Mengniu and Yili, but who is the one with the problem?"
"lag, crappy resolution, poor network connection"
Jingdong now finds that it is becoming more and more rubbish
Drink Mengniu and be happy until death
"I think the size is suitable, easy to carry, and the price is very good. ."
"The product is cost-effective, but the black border is very wide, which is far inferior to fruit. Fortunately, the price is different."
"Computers are good and powerful, so good."
It’s a scam. There are no earplugs. It’s bad.
I am speechless about Mengniu and some domestic milk manufacturers.
"It crashes at any time, hey! Cheap but no good goods"
"Generally speaking, no gifts have been given yet"
"Following the Huawei brand, Huawei is still cost-effective, and I usually watch videos and so on. Quite like it"
"When I took it home, my daughter was very happy and loved it."
"Without anxiety, it is possible to do as much as possible"
"The fever is so severe that there are no accessories including headphones. When I placed the order, I remembered to include a power bank, but nothing came out."
"Not easy to use, slow to respond. Thick and heavy. Re-entered Apple."
The product I bought broke and I replaced it. The price was reduced by 100 before the new one came. I still can’t use the external storage and I don’t want to replace it.
"I just received the goods. There is only one charger, one device, and no ear wires. Damn, this is too...,,,,,,,,,,,,"
"First of all, it looks good and is comfortable to hold. The sound effect is really good. It’s my first time buying a Huawei tablet and it’s been well received."
"The phone is good, but JD logistics is too slow."
The font is too small and I can't adjust it to a larger size. I'm very dissatisfied. JD.com's service is still okay.
"I hope that conscientious companies can develop better, and scum like Mengniu and Yili will be shut down as soon as possible! It’s best never to be reincarnated~"
"After using it for a few days, I feel good. The 2k screen is very good. My mobile phone also has a 2k screen. It is very good to read PDFs. The akg headphones are also good. I feel the sound quality is better than my Xiaomi hifi headphones."
"I’m looking forward to the collective red carpet and performance at the Mengniu Music Festival on September 17th. All the suits will kill me instantly! It is said to be in Beijing. I really want to see it live! I hope I can get the Best Newcomer Award as I wish, good luck!"
The workmanship is good and there is no lag when watching videos. I will try it again later.
"The goods arrived in the afternoon, and the price was reduced in the evening. Price protection was not allowed. It was said that there would be gifts, but when I saw it, there were gifts after the price reduction. Now that the freebies have been distributed, tell me that the freebies are worth *RMB. No one can explain this. What a disappointment."
"So what do you drink? Yili? Milk, never drink Mengniu!"
"It's not as big as expected, but otherwise it's fine! The quality feels pretty good! Jingdong Express is so awesome, orders arrive on the same day! ! !"
"Slow response, impractical and difficult to use. Very bad"
I bought it for an elderly person and haven't found any problems so far. Hope it will always be useful.
Reduce the price after buying it. You can do it on JD.com
"When I received the goods, I simply stuck some scotch tape on the packaging box. I didn’t know if it had been used by someone else, and there were not enough accessories inside, including the missing pin. It was a very unsatisfactory purchase."
"In use, it's working well"
"Overall, things look average. It has not been officially used yet, and will be reviewed after use."
Response is very slow
"Huawei Honor is a very good phone tablet, and children like it. It’s just that the screen is a bit small"
"The style is okay, but the battery is terrible. It can last a day and a night just by playing with WeChat. But if you watch videos, it won’t last a day. I have to go to the after-sales service when I have time."
"Screen malfunction, disappointment, fix it yourself."
"One star for the courier guy who came over to take a look at the product and found that the buttons are very loose! The price is reasonable, right? The charger is 0.2A, and it charges 34% in 8 hours?"
"Very good, very good"
"Affordable price, quick response and easy to use."
"I'm sorry to lower the price so quickly. I'm deceiving old customers... I'm still thinking about buying another one. If I wasn't planning to buy one, I wouldn't even know the price has dropped."
Mengniu green good mood
The delivery speed is not unusually slow. It took more than half a month to receive it. It’s really rubbish.
"It’s sad that there are no gifts, bad review"
The delicious food has been discovered. Thank you for your favor for Mengniu products. Tutu is also very dreamy.
"The quality is so bad, the screen went black in less than a month, and I can’t return or exchange it!"
"It’s a very good tablet, with good battery life and fast speed. It’s on sale again. It seems like I made a bad purchase."
"The first time I arrived, I couldn’t connect to the Bluetooth wireless network! Replaced! The packaging has been changed and it’s not completely plastic sealed! This must be a rewind scene! Now even playing Happy Landlords can cause the game to freeze and force it to close! ! !"
Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu! Pure milk is a commercial fraud.
"There are no virtual buttons, and it is very smooth to use. There is no miscellaneous software. The screen film provided by the software is of poor quality. After all, it is provided! I bought another Blu-ray and haven’t received it yet. Overall, I feel good. The packaging box design is quite exquisite."
"I bought it for a friend, but as soon as I bought it, I got a blue screen, which made me mad."
"A bottle of Youyi C after a meal, happy as a god, Mengniu?"
"How disgusting~ Another blacklist~ Mengniu has had trouble again, and this time the data is even lower... Whether it's true or not, Mengniu really can't drink anymore!"
"With Mengniu, I am not afraid. I feel like my future is dark..."
"I bought the phone in August and it has always been normal. After charging it and turning it on at night, I noticed that the screen was bright red."
"Everything is good, but the clarity is not very good and the pixels are too poor! !"
Fake goods must be returned
"They deceive consumers by clearly saying that there are gifts, but when they receive the goods, there are no gifts. They also have to spend money to buy covers and films. Jingdong doesn’t believe it anymore."
Send Mengniu...health is the best gift.
"Authentic, the gifts are also good"
The stuff is good and I was pleasantly surprised when I put it in. It’s just a bit heavy and very cost-effective.
"Not bad, very smooth and easy to use"
Mengniu very good milk
"This thing is so expensive. What about banana flavored milk, what about banana, that suggestion to make myself Mengniu Guangming, also have banana flavored milk, it will definitely not be so expensive! Hum hum hum?(?^?)?"
"The machine is not good,"
The lost sister in Beijing is Mengniu Chunzhen
The shopping experience on JD.com is extremely rubbish. Cherish your life and stay away from JD.com.
"The screen resolution is super low, and the brightness is not enough to watch TV."
Things are okay. I feel a little inferior to the Huawei p9.
I bought it for my grandpa. I think it’s okay. I haven’t used it and I don’t know what it’s like. It’s still worth the price. But the logistics is too slow?
"I don’t understand why the tablet I bought on October 15th contained photos from January 10th, 2016. I have always believed JD.com’s self-operated products, which is so disappointing! ! !"
It is really inconsistent with the flagship phone of the year. The WiFi is never stable and the 4G signal is so-so. The key is that the system optimization is not enough at all. It is even harder to say that it is good. It is harder to use than Xiaomi's system.
Very good and very practical. Express delivery is very fast.
"Regardless of the quality of the goods, JD.com now charges a lot of money and the service is terrible!"
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"In a word, the sound quality of the tablet is as good as that of JD Express!"
"The tablet is average. When I took the photo, I was told that it would come with a protective case, but it didn’t come with a protective cover, nor did it come with a touch screen protector. One star for logistics."
"Shameless face, so disgusting. I haven’t drank Mengniu for many years."
"This must be rated well. Starting from my p8, router, p9, and m3, I feel that these are getting easier and easier to use. I sincerely support Huawei and are proud of being made in China. This m3 is of good quality and has no problem challenging Apple. . ."
Not bad. Just started using it.
"The response was super slow and the 4G network didn't work. The sound on the video call was super low. I took it to the repair shop and the store said it had to be returned to the manufacturer. I went... It's just that, the new one has to be returned to the manufacturer. What kind of product did they give me? ? ? ? Third hand? ? ?"
"Very good, worth buying"
The hotel delivers two bags of milk every day. I drank it unconsciously. I found out today that it was from Mengniu. I stopped drinking it.
"I've been using this one, and it's fine for daily play."
"After using it for a few days, I feel good. The screen is big and clear enough. I can play games smoothly and watch TV series very clearly. It’s good, good, and good."
"Not long after I bought it, it started to get stuck. I don’t know why it’s so stuck. I’m very disappointed."
This time I added unknown medicinal powder =???= I won’t use Mengniu red date milk anymore because it’s really hard to drink...
I'm quite satisfied with it after buying it to read books.
"It’s been a month since I received the phone, but I haven’t received the invoice yet. I contacted after-sales service and was told to process it as soon as possible, but there is no result yet. Is it questionable whether it is genuine? Continue to complain without giving an invoice!"
"It was clearly written that a mobile phone case would be delivered, but I didn’t receive it. I contacted customer service and said it was in stock, but they didn’t deliver it. It was quite a scam. It’s delivered when you buy it, but it’s gone when it arrives."
"The size ratio of 16:10 is similar to that of a mobile phone, and it can be used by many mobile phone software. The black bars at the top and bottom are very small when watching movies, and movies are now 16:9. I don’t like the 4:3 one."
"Rubbish, the price was reduced before I got the item I just bought*"
"Very good, not bad"
"M2 is really cost-effective. Bought one for my child at 618 discount. I'm very satisfied, but the boss is too picky and doesn't even give me a screensaver."
"stuck, not playing the game smoothly,"
It’s been two months since I bought it and now I can’t turn it on. I’m so worried that I won’t use Huawei products in the future.
"Those who bought it in early June told me that it was the same as the 618 discount. When I looked at it today, I said that there were more gifts than before. I strongly recommend that you buy things from JD.com on the day of events and never buy them again."
garbage tablet
"Power consumption is fast, response is slow, and no invoice has been provided yet"
"I bought it for 999 and used a 30 coupon. I have seen this for more than 1,000 before. I bought it for my mother. She likes it very much. It is very thin and the sound is very comfortable."
What kind of service is this? It’s a typical consumer fraud. There aren’t any promised gifts. It’s a shame that I support JD.com so much! Bad review
Never drink Mengniu
Boycott Mengniu! What I hate the most is the senior officials of Mengniu. They have no sense of serving the people. Such a national enterprise should not be regarded as the milk of Mengniu.
It's very good. It's very comfortable to watch TV series. The setting of the children's playground is also very scientific.
"Secondly, when the phone was delivered, it didn’t have a screen protector. There wasn’t even a regular screen protector. The screen was bright and shiny. I wiped it. This is a trap."
There is nothing to say about the workmanship. It is ultra-thin and the sound quality is particularly good. I feel that even Apple cannot produce such an ultra-thin effect. It is quite good.
Boycott Mengniu~What’s the use of irresponsible companies? Repost on Weibo
"My headphones were taken away by JD.com, I’m so angry"
Mengniu’s new packaging is so refreshing~
"After turning on the computer, there is nothing on the screen. When I called customer service and Huawei’s official phone number, no one answered it. I feel dizzy. I have to go back to Chongqing to visit the service point tomorrow. My shopping failed..."
The customer service attitude is too bad.
Mainland people are not human! ! ! Boycott Mengniu Repost on Weibo
Going to Mengniu tomorrow!
"Bought this for my son, he loves it! Support JD.com"
The battery life is good and I can watch three movies in a row.
"They are evil companies, and everyone should join forces to stop buying from them. I'm very curious why Shuanghui Mengniu and other companies have problems again and again, and even if they don't sue them, people still buy their products. Isn't this raising a tiger's risk?"
The purchase that took the longest delivery time used to be received within 24 hours.
"The installation is quick, which is really good. It will jump when the temperature reaches to save power. Beautiful is good"
"The screen is not very clear, and the touch screen is OK, but there is no film attached at the factory, but the customer service said there is one, which is purely a lie, and explained that I'm sorry, it has wool for use, and if you have any questions, let me know."
It's really good. I bought it for my mother. I can watch movies or make phone calls when I have nothing to do. I don't have to worry about the elderly people not being able to see clearly. Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
"The price is high and the quality is good. The second time I purchased it, I asked for a VAT invoice and the one I received was a regular invoice."
"The only thing we can do is not to drink the products of Mengniu Yili, a black-hearted enterprise that has been exposed!"
"Great computer, I like it very much, it’s worth it"
"First of all, this mobile phone’s SIM card 2 can only use the 2G network (holy crap, is this a scam)?"
"All the home appliances and electronic products at home are from JD.com, and they were delivered the next day. I haven’t had time to use them yet, but they all feel great in my hands."
"The service is very good, the quality is excellent, recommended."
"There is something wrong with the battery, it takes a long time to charge! One or two hours is only 4%! Why don't you be so deceptive! Request a return or exchange! It’s so infuriating! Can you have some integrity!"
Don’t dare to drink Mengniu’s milk. Are you trying to poison us and silence us?
"Okay, almost as expected"
"After asking for a long time, no one responded. The service is so bad. It is still an official store. I really can’t compliment it."
"Not bad, it’s very fast now that I’m using it."
The packaging boxes for used phones all have the Lenovo logo on them! Only to realize that the rear camera doesn’t even have a flash! The screen PPI is not very high! Try it first and see if there are any other problems!
"It’s just a big mobile phone with a poor resolution, just for kids to play with! difference difference difference"
Stupid Mengniu
This is my first time using Huawei. I pay attention to domestic products. This phablet is also the best.
"The clarity is not good, and you have to use a lot of force to touch the screen. You get what you pay for, and your intestines are ruined."
The price was reduced by * yuan just after I bought it. It’s so sad.
"Can't turn on the phone, can't charge. So disappointed."
"Bought for children to learn English. The size is suitable, it feels good in the hand, it's relatively light, the sound effect is really good, it has two speakers and the screen is clear. It’s just that the price is a bit expensive and the CPU is a bit old."
It’s too bad. There is a corner of the tempered film that cannot be attached. The response of the phone is too poor. Other phones on the same network are more than twice as fast as it.
"It feels ok, but comes with too many systems"
"The stuff is good and I will buy it next time! Believe in JD.com, believe in Brother Dong"
"The arrival was really fast, but I was a little disappointed when I opened it and found a bare machine."
"It’s okay, for the elderly"
This is the second one I have bought. It is very convenient for the elderly to use and the quality is good.
"I just bought a new phone, and when I searched for pictures on Baidu, there was screen smearing. I was very dissatisfied!"
"I don’t want to say anything, the store is bullying customers!"
This is the second time I bought this tablet.
"Damn JD.com’s customer service is so fucked. When I opened the product, there were obvious fingerprints on the screen. I checked the activation date and it was last month. When I asked the customer service, I asked them to contact after-sales service. It’s so cool for a merchant to do this."
"It’s very suitable. It was a flash sale during the special price. Haha, I’m so kind and happy."
"Mengniu's customer service is so awesome... I just finished posting a Weibo post with ""Mengniu"" in it, and asked if I could help in any way... I admire it..."
Very satisfied so far.
"Just like the original mobile phone, once you get used to it, if the one breaks, you can buy the same one, which is much cheaper."
"There is nothing wrong with the item. Less than 8 hours after the order was placed, the price was reduced by 200. Can you make any more mistakes? I really don’t want to give you a penny, and I really don’t want to buy anything on JD.com in the future."
The workmanship is a bit rough
"I bought this for my mother, she likes it very much"
A very unsatisfactory shopping... although the items are still good... but the order placed on the 16th... was received on the 26th...
What? It’s not good at all. I had to upgrade myself when I first arrived. The wifi is still not connected.
"I'm so angry! It’s just a tablet that’s less than 2,000 yuan. As for taking out other people’s returns and selling them directly? Can you deal with the fingerprints on the screen?"
"I regretted it when I bought it. After playing an APP for less than ten minutes, my phone became very hot. I had never experienced this with any junk phone before."
Mengniu Sponsored
"The delivery speed is very fast, but the only drawback is that the price was reduced as soon as it arrived."
"What do you mean? The flash sale happened right after I bought it. I *bought* it, and now I am doubting your product..."
"The pixels of the mobile phone are inferior to those of other brand-name phones. The mobile phone is very hot. When I first installed the card, there was no service. In the end, it took three activations before it could be used. It is a fighter among garbage."
"There is something wrong with the display. This time the X2 is still the same. There is only a cancel button for all applications, the OK button cannot be displayed, and there are blind spots!"
"I really like playing with my mobile phone, but now I can’t do it anymore. It’s just like that, and it’s not very good to use it."
I feel that the quality of the products sold on JD.com is different from that of physical stores. This device does not display when I insert the SD card.
I am really speechless about Jingdong...
Very good and practical
"The sound effect is good, the workmanship is fine, the price is relatively high, and it supports domestic products!"
It took me so long to comment that the extended memory cannot be used.
"Very good, the material is very good, I like it better"
Mengniu Big Fruit Yogurt ~ Healthy and happy every day ~ I am in #????? Teaching Building # http:t.cn/zj5z2L9
"The function description of the mobile phone is unclear, which may lead to deception."
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha That’s great
"My mother really likes Huawei's tablet computer, which has plenty of memory and good internet speed."
"It couldn't have been Mengniu, right? Punish the real culprits severely!"
"I heard many people affected by the disaster were forced to sing loudly for the government, and I also saw many leaders carrying Mengniu to express condolences to the victims. Should I be moved?"
"The upper left corner of the back actually cracked! I originally wanted to return the product, but the customer service said it would take fifteen days. I was in a hurry to use it, so I would buy a condom to cover my ugly face in the future! It seems that buying mobile phones online is still risky."
Support domestic brands. China is no longer the China of the past. I am very satisfied with the products and you deserve them!
It’s a good machine. It’s already the third one.
It's okay. It feels a bit big.
"It supports domestic production, so buy it from Huawei and give it a try. You won’t regret it at all. The 2k resolution is very comfortable and high-definition! The whole texture is very good. The iPad has been thrown aside."
"It just arrived the day before yesterday, *. It arrived yesterday. Today, let’s see if you can use coupons to further reduce the change. How to give a good review?"
Hope to keep up the good work
Average quality
"Huawei Lanyue M2 Tablet PC, buy it from JD.com at 618. Huawei is a brand you have always trusted! Jingdong Logistics has nothing to say, buy it at night and it will arrive at noon the next day!"
"The phone is good, the screen is big, it runs smoothly, and the courier guy has a good attitude. I will check the performance in the future. It would be better if I get a case as a gift!"
"The express delivery is great, it’s very comfortable to use, and the size is just right. I switched from Android to iPhone and bought it to play King of Kings."
"I used to drink all kinds of milk. I drank Sanlu at first, then stopped drinking Mengniu, then stopped drinking Yili, and then stopped drinking Guangming. Now I don’t drink any milk."
"It's an exaggeration, not ideal, just buy it! ! !"
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no"
Can’t eat Mengniu anymore
"The quality of Midea's products and services are first-class, and the express delivery is also very fast. I am very satisfied! I will unanimously support Midea products!"
"It’s not easy to use at all, and it’s very stuck. It’s not as good as something worth over 300."
top! Mengniu should close down soon! I really hate Mengniu
"It was the first time I bought it on JD.com. I originally thought the price was okay, but the price dropped within a week and they wouldn’t refund the difference. He may not buy it again in the future."
It’s pretty good. I don’t get stuck when playing Honor of Kings. I mainly bought it for my daughter. The picture quality is pretty clear when watching movies and TV shows!
"The running speed is fast, the screen pixels are okay, and it is enough for watching movies."
"Not bad, the screen is big enough, I think it is more suitable for watching movies and TV series. Huawei quality is really good. The whole family uses Huawei."
"Don’t drink Mengniu, don’t drink Yili! #???# http:t.cn/zj6VPob"
"Mengniu Youyi C went bad while it was still within the shelf life! ! Throw away all 3 bottles! Mengniu, you are too rubbish! Our family no longer drinks milk from Mengniu. Think about it, the lactic acid bacteria will not be there anymore! The result was so disappointing! Mengniu"
"Huawei tablet is worth owning. The screen resolution is very good, the system is easy to use, and the sound effects are good. It is the best for watching videos and playing games."
It's just right for the elderly.
Jingdong is getting worse and worse. I am basically unsatisfied with my shopping this year.
"Very good, but the film cannot be applied properly? The one I put on was really ugly and ruined a sticker."
"Genuine goods at a reasonable price, genuine products, fast delivery"
"Very good, very cost-effective, the screen is large, and the camera function is also very clear, very suitable for the elderly"
"Rubbish tablet, used a few times. The screen doesn’t listen to you anymore."
"Bought for a colleague, the delivery is fast, the system is smooth to use, and the price/performance ratio is quite high."
"There are obvious bumps on the frame, the battery cover has scratches, the upper and lower sections have gaps with the battery cover, and are uneven, and the upper and lower ends are higher than the battery cover. It feels like it's not installed properly."
There are quality issues.
"The screen is big enough, which is great for watching videos."
Very good. I always buy large items and electronic products from JD.com. Trustworthy.
"The flat packaging is perfect, it feels good to use, and it supports JD.com and Huawei. Thanks!"
I like it even more after I got it. It looks beautiful and runs smoothly. It’s worth it. I have nothing to say about Huawei.
"Not bad, very satisfied, logistics is fast."
"The packaging is so bad, there’s not even a bubble"
"To be honest, I don’t recommend buying 16G. It has terrible lag and super slow response. I regretted it only a few days after I got it. The price is also constantly changing, which is super depressing. There is a promotion of 100% off for purchases over 1,000 as soon as I buy it. What do you think about Jingdong!"
"I am in Xinjiang, and I received my mobile phone the next day after placing the order. I have been shopping online for more than 10 years, and this is the first time it has been so fast. Total 5 points."
This is the worst value for money mobile phone I have ever bought. I'm really speechless. I often freeze and have no signal. I often make calls and the other party can't hear me. I'm also drunk.
Recommended it to my sister and she said it works well.
"The time is too slow, and 2499 doesn’t even come with a set, and the new phone is a bit stuck."
"It feels very good and no problems were found. It runs smoothly, but the system is not smart enough! It would be nice if the system could be improved."
"Not good,,,,,, not good or not, I don’t want to say anything"
"There is nothing as a gift, just a mobile phone."
It's far behind Huawei's mobile phones. I hope Huawei can make tablets as good as Apple.
The touch screen is not very easy to use
The overall condition is good and the price/performance ratio is okay. Huawei is still a very good brand.
I bought it for my nephew. I couldn’t put it down. I downloaded a lot of various learning and gaming software. I have something to do at home. JD.com is fast. I placed an order in the early morning and received it in the afternoon.
"The picture looks clear, it’s entirely due to the camera on my mobile phone. Going crazy."
"Easy to use, big enough, good for watching TV series"
"Super cost-effective, cheaper than mobile phone stores, worth buying"
"Support domestic production, I have bought several units"
"I bought it for * yuan, but it became * yuan as soon as I placed the order. I applied for price protection but was rejected. JD.com is too shady."
"I think it's okay, but after applying the film, it doesn't slide a bit, which makes it very annoying when playing games."
"The flat outer packaging that arrived was soaked. But seeing that the courier was also caught in the rain, I still accepted the delivery. In the future, it is recommended that express delivery be wrapped in plastic bags when it rains."
"Jingdong is very fast, and I got it on the same day. The M3 is simple and beautiful, fast, and the size is just right."
"I’ve been using it for two months and it feels okay, but the system is a bit old. All Huawei phones are version 6.0, but this one is still 4.0."
Very poor shopping experience! ! !
"Yes, I received it better than expected, no lag or lag. 1,000 yuan is really appropriate. You can also buy Jingdong Baitiao."
"Hey... Mengniu has a problem, is Yili still far behind? Fortunately, I never drink Mengniu."
"Well, it feels so good to work together, and the voting for this year’s Mengniu Music Chart is really heartwarming."
It's not very good. It's stuck. It's terrible!
"I have always disliked Mengniu, and I despise Mengniu again. . . You are so mean. I never drink milk because I don’t like the taste of milk; I don’t want to see Mengniu milk anymore because you make me sick."
Problems occurred twice in a row in two months
"Trustworthy products, always buy them on JD.com"
Resolutely resist silly talk! Boycott Mengniu!
Very comfortable and big. I can play the game without any lag. It’s awesome. The picture quality is very good.
I bought a mobile phone without an invoice. I contacted customer service for a day and there was no reply. Is it so difficult to issue an invoice? Jingdong defaults to not giving paper invoices. I despise it.
"The tablet is okay. The battery is not durable. Also, the outer packaging of the box has been torn. There is dust on the tablet. I am not satisfied."
"Stay away from Mengniu, whoever gets involved will die. Lao Mo’s great reputation will be destroyed at the hands of X Niu"
"The headphones don't work well when plugged in, and I don't want to go to the after-sales service to replace them. Everything else is fine."
"You get a discount after buying it, and the gift you get is not guaranteed. Who asked you to give it in the first place? How disgusting! It's better to give negative stars!"
"It arrived quickly, the price is very favorable, the sound quality is good, the screen quality is not as good as the iPad, it feels good and responds quickly."
"Supporting domestic products, the expectations are not very high, but even taking pictures is not possible, the response is slow, I am really speechless, I can only return the product"
It's very useful. I've been using it for many days and it really works! ! !
The order placed at 22:30 on the evening of the 10th was reduced by 50 yuan on the 11th. I can't make that much even if I work for 1.5 hours! What the hell is this trash Huawei!
"The promised gift was gone, unscrupulous merchant."
It's okay. It has such a function at this price. I think it's more reasonable. I'm also concerned about whether it can be expanded.
I just received the item today and it's still charging. Please rate after using it
"The price was reduced before I received the goods. What happened? Don't bring something like this. I bought so many things on JD.com, but this time it turned out to be so deceptive."
The charging is not ideal and the battery lasted less than a day. I plan to return it and have it repaired. I will only return it if there is something wrong. I will never trust JD again.
Looks good! Not used yet! The reviews all say it’s good! So buy one for your parents and play games! Make phone calls...
"Good, good, good, good, good, good"
"Mengniu has the best food, bar none! like melted vanilla ice cream"
"The things are okay. After all, things that only cost a few hundred yuan cannot be compared with those that cost thousands. What I want to say is that Jingdong’s packaging is too irresponsible. Here is the picture attached."
"So far it’s okay, the screen is big and cheap, it’s a great tool for mom to watch movies~~~~~~~~~"
"I don’t know what to say, just pay for it."
"It’s so easy to use, a satisfying online purchase"
good! I am quite satisfied with the appearance and thickness.
"Bad review. The delivery was fast, but there was no invoice. I asked customer service twice, but they still haven’t solved it yet!"
The quality is very good. It is really worth buying such a good product at this price. The screen is clear and responsive.
"good. Good quality, cheap price, fast delivery"
"The size is a bit small, but it’s enough for watching movies. It’s been dropped without any problems (the tempered film I bought cracked). My sister is using it and likes it very much. The performance is good."
Mengniu Guanyi Milk every day to enhance the body’s immunity O(?_?)O~@ Guanyi Milk
"There is noise when talking on that mobile phone, and sometimes the other party cannot hear the sound, and there is a gurgling sound when playing music."
The wireless signal is not good and 4G often fails to connect. Have you ever seen such a bad camera? How does the machine perform? Is the heat dissipation good? How is the quality of the accessories? Tell everyone about your experience of using it!
I go~~~~~~~~~ Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu! Brother Long was almost poisoned to death. He is an unscrupulous businessman with a black heart! @ the leaves with unique skills
This monkey was beaten very badly after drinking Mengniu. . Can you tell me if this guy drank Mengniu? !
"The sound quality is good, and it has texture, so overall it's okay."
"It’s pretty good, but I wanted to buy the MiPad Mi 3 more, but unfortunately I didn’t get it."
It's a good product. It would be better if the packaging is cleaner. You can still consider buying it. The price is affordable.
"It's okay, the little guy likes it very much, but there is no screen saver. ."
"This tablet only has 10.16g of storage, which is normally at least fourteen. It seems that the boss of Jingdong is very good at cutting corners when doing this, which makes people look uncomfortable. When looking for a lady named Zhang, she never cuts corners."
"The stuff is pretty good, but the packaging is really speechless and makes a loud noise."
No fault found so far
"High cost performance, fast delivery, and supports domestic products!"
"No black edges, long standby time, worth buying."
"The size is suitable, it's smooth to use, and the battery is relatively durable. It's worth the price."
"I haven’t upgraded the system yet. I just turned it on. The startup sound is great. After a quick look, there are no white spots on the screen."
This time I purchased it for a customer. It will be used as a music player in the live broadcast truck of the radio station and will not be opened for the time being.
"Fast delivery, average product, you get what you pay for"
Fast delivery and good service attitude
Mengniu’s old yogurt is definitely more delicious.
Huawei's products are indeed very useful. I will recommend my colleagues to buy them in the future.
It's pretty good and the battery lasts a long time.
"He actually used Shuanghui to treat his guests, which is too cruel. I think if I order more Mengniu, I will definitely die."
"Very good, just the right size!"
"Okay, I bought it for a friend"
It arrived yesterday and I have been using it for a day. I haven’t found any problems yet. The pixels are fine.
I bought it last night and the price was reduced today. Bad review.
"It's a scam, it's a scam. As soon as I got the phone, the price was reduced by 20 yuan. It's a scam. The font is a bit small. I bought it for my mother. She said she couldn't see it clearly. I regretted buying Huawei. It's a scam."
"Now they don't give you an invoice. You ask customer service and they say they will reissue it, and then they ask me for an early date after the courier arrives? Why didn't you tell me in advance? work error"
not bad. . .
Very good. I bought it for watching TV. It is more convenient than a pad. It can also make calls. The internet speed is okay and the memory is slightly smaller.
The overlord of Jingdong! ! ! Shameless Jingdong! ! !
"Ordered in the early morning and the goods were delivered in the evening, so fast! The phone is good, the size is large, the touch is very sensitive, and watching videos is smooth and without lag. It looks beautiful and is also practical."
"There is a gap at the connection between the plastic and the metal at the corner of the speaker, causing the entire lower connection to be flat on one side and warped on the other! The flaws are too obvious! The plastic feels so soft when pressed! And the wireless signal is not good! Poor packaging"
"Purchased 3 times, good"
"Buying Mengniu is suicide, other brands are at most considered manslaughter."
"The machine is very laggy, even when playing games, and it is a bare machine when I bought it, without even a film, alas. , please be careful if you want to buy it, the difference is bad"
I bought 9 of them in one go and they are very easy to use.
I really like Mengniu’s new packaging! ! !
"The tablet is beautiful, easy to use and downloads smoothly."
Our sorrow is that these garbage companies will eventually survive like the shame of the nation such as Mengniu and Yili.
"This phone is really good. I’ve already bought my second one. My colleague just asked me to buy one for her, so I thought of reviewing it."
"Support domestic production, Huawei is really good"
"No, it will freeze? Sometimes it will restart itself."
I just got it today and it’s working fine for the initial use. I don’t know what problems may arise if I use it in the future! ! !
The items are very good and the logistics speed is very fast. Next day delivery.
"I give it one point because JD.com’s delivery speed is amazing! I am very disappointed with this purchase. Apart from the mobile phone and charger, there is nothing else such as earphones, protective film, protective case, power bank, etc. ???A very disappointing shopping!"
"Jingdong's delivery speed is very fast, the packaging is complete, and the machine quality and performance are good."
"Average, there will be lag, watching movies is okay"
A very good Huawei tablet worth owning
"No invoice, that's it, bad review,"
It's disgusting. Mengniu is really bad now. The protein is too high.
"Without criticism there is no progress. New Mengniu will insist on opening the door to provide convenience for netizen supervision, continuously improve management, and produce high-quality milk for consumers."
This is the second Huawei tablet. It is really great. The large screen is very clear. It is enough for watching videos and movies. The appearance is also very beautiful and majestic.
The experience this time was very bad. I only had the phone for a day and there were no problems for the time being. The problem lies in the details. The connector of the charging cable cannot be used. Huawei and JD after-sales service are pushing each other but not solving the problem.
"The mobile phone arrived today, but the space cleaning shows that it has not been cleaned for 16 days. What is the reason? Is it a refurbished machine?"
"Bought for an elderly person, no doubt genuine, used it once after installation, parents are very satisfied"
"A relative gave me a box of drinks, which was quite a happy thing, but when I looked at the brand, it turned out to be from Mengniu. I was confused, so I thought I might as well drink it. If I throw it away, Mengniu would have no loss, but I would have a loss."
"The product is acceptable, but JD.com’s service is terrible, and they blame each other. The delivery was too slow. I had to wait four days for the product to be delivered, and I didn’t know anything during the period."
"Super bad review, product not received, JD.com has shown receipt"
"Not bad, value for money!"
It's just so-so. There's almost nothing delivered.
The phone is stuck and the delivery is very slow. I have been waiting for several days. The phone seems to be used.
It is inconvenient to eat and the taste is extremely unpleasant. I will definitely not buy Mengniu in the future. I can only say that curiosity kills! ! !
It took a lot of genius to evaluate it. The standby time is very long. I bought it for watching TV and I am very satisfied.
I see there are always giveaways. Why didn't you send it? You might as well not write that there are gifts. Do you only give it to buyers who have confirmed it before buying?
"Good quality and low price, good value for money;"
"Bad review, definitely give a bad review, first time I bought a mobile phone on JD.com, but I felt like I was cheated"
"Although Bingrui’s banana milk is indeed delicious, Mengniu’s banana milk from Inner Mongolia is also good and comparable. I support domestic products! The outer packaging is also very cute@baozigecuharmengniu"
"Very good and practical, JD.com is the best"
Overall it's okay
"Mengniu’s new product looks delicious, let’s try it together @????also??? Baby"
I couldn't wait to start playing games when I got it back. It feels great and I hope it can last for 2 years.
"Huawei's machines are definitely good, but this is the first time I encountered JD.com's worst service. I don't want to shop on JD.com in the future."
I've only been using it for less than 2 months and it's stuck like crazy. It's rubbish. I regret it.
The performance is pretty good and the photo pixels are not very high.
Have a bottle of Mengniu to harm yourself. http:t.cn/zjv7bZ7 (from @?PIN)
Mengniu doesn’t taste good
"I received a white screen, which is so depressing. I don't know if it's a quality issue or just a coincidence. I hope it's a case."
"No, I don’t have a mobile phone yet."
I placed an order yesterday and the price was reduced by RMB 300 today. I am also fascinated by JD.com’s price fluctuations. Can I choose to return it? Low scores do not apply to products...
Fast delivery!
"Very good, very satisfied, my mother likes it very much"
"I support it, but even so, it’s very difficult to guarantee that there won’t be any problems, given the current environment! Mengniu needs to be more angry!"
"Dad is very satisfied, the screen is big enough, holding the phone is like lifting bricks"
"Mengniu people built Mengniu, but Mengniu is just too awesome."
"Good logistics, trustworthy, genuine,"
"I can’t see the real-time network speed, there are still a lot of functions missing, and there are a bunch of junk system software that I can’t delete, but I’m using my data all day long. One gigabyte of data a month is not enough."
It doesn’t play well at all and I want to return it! ! !
Bad review. I downloaded two episodes of a TV series when the tablet arrived. Then it got stuck when I watched it. I just bought a new phone and it got stuck. It’s so bad but the logistics is pretty good.
"Really, high-end and classy. It’s just one word, “big”!"
"It's okay, but it's too long"
Mengniu should go bankrupt.
The screen is scratched and there is glue that cannot be wiped off. What the hell is this! ! What rubbish is this!
"Things arrived very quickly, I have to admire JD.com’s speed! When you open it, you can see that it looks pretty good. It's very easy to use, no problems at the moment."
Fast delivery and the packaging looks in good condition. Let's see if you use it
"I checked and found that I started shopping on JD.com in 2010. I bought a lot of things, but I have never commented on them! This is the first time!"
"The kids loved it, it was pretty fast"
"Now I don’t worry about anything I eat, and I’m starting to suspect prostitution! Mengniu, let me tell you what is good about you."
"Average, bad, negative review"
"You can insert a phone card, which is pretty good"
The quality of the Huawei I bought this time is not as good as before. The multimedia volume is too low and the photos are not clear.
Just don’t drink Mengniu!
The stuff is very good and I like it very much. It’s worth the money.
"If I didn't know how to rate 0 stars, I wouldn't even give it a star. It's rubbish. The touch screen doesn't work at all when charging. It doesn't work at all as long as it's charging. It's rubbish!"
It’s really good-looking. Mengniu’s advertisement is also very good-looking.
"Slow logistics...nothing was delivered, not even the film."
"In general, it is not very easy to use, there are many useless software that cannot be uninstalled, and the resolution is not good. It is no different from a copycat phone. It is only worth 500. Huawei was built by the navy. Don’t be blindly patriotic."
"There are no gifts, and the items are heavier than normal. It feels fake. I can’t help but the price is just like this. I advise everyone not to spend that much money and buy the real thing."
The function is very powerful and the operating performance is okay
"The delivery was very slow, and they gave me various excuses, and I couldn't find a solution."
"After using it for a few days, I feel fine! It’s just not very convenient to carry!"
The computer is fine. The one I was given is old and slow to respond... I just placed an order elsewhere and got an 8-inch one.
"Not bad, very easy to use! Smooth, no lag."
Why don’t you drink Mengniu? Are you looking down on Chinese companies?
"No, please don’t buy it. You can’t connect to the Internet after using it for a few days."
"There's nothing wrong with Yilimeng's cattle, it's the people who have it"
The phone is easy to use and it’s fun to watch the show
"Not great, the video is blurry"
"I bought this item for my 78-year-old grandfather. It is very convenient for him to use and the JD.com delivery is very fast. In short, I am very satisfied. The elderly mainly watch TV series and news. The standard configuration is enough, please refer to it."
The mobile phone is very good. I have purchased this model of mobile phone for the second time. It is very comfortable to watch TV.
"The wireless tablet gets stuck when connected, and the quality is too poor."
Uses it quickly! The screen is huge! My friend likes it so much that she wants to get one!
I am very satisfied with the product I bought and gave it a good review.
Returning me 6g garbage customer service will only ask me to rate it
Fast speed and good service attitude
I just received the goods in the afternoon. Jingdong is very fast. The order I placed last night should have been received at ??. Thank you to the courier guy for your hard work! Dongdong has just been opened and will be added later.
"It’s not bad, I just feel it’s a bit stuck, but the price is about the same, and it’ll be about the same after a year or two."
It took me a long time to evaluate it. The quality of the phone is good and the price is reasonable. I give it five stars and support JD shopping.
"I've already played it, it's pretty good"
I bought it for someone else. I tried it and it was ok. It should be good.
Never eat it again! My day. . . Mengniu is such a cheat!
"The quality was very poor, so I decided to return it after using it for a day. Too bad workmanship"
"Cutting cakes cheats money, Mengniu cheats lives! At least the cut cake is not poisoned! Mengniu is indeed more cheating than the cut cake. Do these idiots like Mengniu think the cut cake is high-end?"
"I can’t play Honor of Kings after downloading it, and it doesn’t work when I go to the browser or app store or anything else. As a result, I can only transfer files face-to-face on QQ. Is there anything like this? I wonder if those Tencent mobile games on Tiantian Kupao will work."
Bought at a special price. The old man likes it.
"The items are pretty good, but the JD courier is not good and has a bad attitude."
"I missed Double Eleven and made up for it on Double Eleven, but it was not cost-effective."
"Huawei's phones are still very good. I will always use Huawei, fingerprint unlocking is also fast"
Mengniu recycles tampered milk: Why not impose heavy penalties to serve as a warning?
"Very good product, a must-have for the family"
Fast delivery. Jingdong express service is good and professional. The courier is attentive. Very satisfied with JD delivery
"Mengniu is so fucking cheating. I accumulated points by drinking Deluxe. I finally got 1,800 points, which I can redeem for something. The points mall has nothing in stock, and the rest can be redeemed with points starting at tens of thousands. You Mom!"
I have been using Huawei before and I like it very much. It is very useful.
I just got the machine. It looks beautiful and the Internet is very fast.
It feels very good and is worth the money. I believe in Huawei's quality.
"What’s even more deceiving is that when I meet Mengniu again, I can’t afford to live, die, or die, and everyone is miserable! ! national. . . . ."
"The system is smooth, can be expanded by TF, and has fingerprint recognition, but the unpressable home button design still makes me feel anti-human."
It’s okay! ! ! ! !
Very good. This is my second purchase. Good reviews!
good. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Very good. Domestic tablets are becoming more and more beautiful.
"The past cannot be grasped, the future cannot be grasped, but the Mengniu Intellectual Mind can be grasped."
"The huge screen looks very comfortable. The 3g memory is a bit regrettable, but it is enough."
"Basically satisfied, you get what you pay for. The speed is still good, it would be better if there is a link to buy a 128g sd card."
Resolution is fine
"It's okay, I feel like the contact isn't very effective"
"The price/performance ratio is okay, and it’s easy and smooth to use, but the resolution is too low!"
It's okay. The screen resolution is just like this. I bought it just to watch movies while running.
"The clarity is a bit poor, but it’s pretty good at this price."
"Nonsense, a weak IQ is a flaw! Mengniu is like that, but people still don’t buy it!"
"Huawei M3 system is very fast, looks beautiful, and is easy to use."
Why are you talking nonsense to Mengniu? Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu! Last time I found out that my wife had bought a box of Mengniu. I was so angry that I snatched it away and used it to water the flowers.
"I bought it at night and the price was reduced by * yuan the next day. When I contacted customer service, they were very impatient! ! ! I encountered the same problem when buying from JD.com 2 years ago. The customer service patiently solved it. What’s wrong with JD.com now? ! ! !"
"The machine is very easy to use, but I forgot to buy a motorcycle or a package. It would be great if there was a package like this that I could make a set of."
The pixels are okay.
"I received it the next day. I bought it for my mother. It is very easy to operate and responds quickly. It is in line with expectations. The mobile phone box is placed in a slightly larger cardboard box. There is no sponge or other things in it. At that time, I was more worried about bumps."
"Long standby time, easy to use"
The performance is good and the screen is clear. . . . . . .
"Bought for 618. When the goods arrive on 6.20, they will not be dispatched. It was delivered on 6.24. It's really anxious to wait. Good value for money. Husband is very satisfied."
I received it in the afternoon after ordering in the morning. It was really fast and the packaging was also very good. I just opened it and it was updating the system. I haven't used it yet. I will review it next time. I believe it will be good.
"Good quality and low price, and installed at your doorstep, which is great"
I bought the wrong thing and it's a bit stuck. It's just so-so.
The fully automated factory is really grand! #walkintomengniufactory#
"The phone has only been used for a day or two and the screen sometimes goes black, and the battery is not durable."
Playing games gets hot quickly
I’m not satisfied with my purchase this time. I bought the same tablet and others gave me a protective tempered mold and a case. Why didn’t I give it as a gift when I bought it?
"If you buy it for the first time, you will get a protective case. The second time I bought it, I lost everything, and the logistics was super slow! ! Ordered on 2.9th, received on 2.17th! !"
It’s for my son to study and protect his eyes. It’s okay.
"Like it very useful. Support domestic products, no problem! Logistics is great."
"Good reviews, I feel good, you see it delays sleep, hehehe."
"What about the promised gift? Is it just hanging on to fool people? There is no invoice, isn't it said that there is an electronic invoice? Where is it?"
"I have been comparing Huawei tablets and iPads before buying them. I personally think that the configuration of Huawei tablets is quite good and the price/performance ratio is very high. After using it for a while, I feel great."
"The mobile phone is a good mobile phone, with a big screen, sufficient battery, and a very cool look, hahahaha~~~~"
"The machine is only suitable for watching videos and so on. It only has 3 games installed, one Wandoujia and 360 games. I think it is suitable for the elderly to relieve their boredom."
"The system is extremely rubbish, with all kinds of inconveniences. You can't even decide the Internet permissions by application. Negative points."
Still buying Mengniu now proves that this parent is extremely irresponsible towards his children. . . Then let’s reveal that we have given up on any Mengniu products!
"Not bad, nothing comes as standard"
"Very useful, I actually bought two of them."
I just bought it a few days ago and I’m still trying it out. I think it’s okay.
"You get what you pay for. What the buyers said is correct. The resolution is very poor and the pixels are very bad, so it can only be sold at this price."
"Not satisfied. The downloaded high-definition video can only be played at standard definition level, which is not clear at all. The picture quality is too poor. The OTG data cable provided is useless and cannot be connected to an external USB flash drive."
"The size of the tablet is good, but the resolution is not too high."
The network signal is so bad. I often don’t have access to the network and it’s laggy. It’s not as good as my Samsung.
"He said he had a mobile phone case, but he didn’t give it to me in the end, damn JD.com"
"This is my first time buying a tablet from JD.com, it’s very good."
"Not bad. Generally, the design of the back button is unreasonable and is reserved for express delivery companies."
The tablet is very easy to use. I got it yesterday and have been using it for half a day. I can watch TV without any lag at all. The clarity is high and it feels heavy when I hold it. I believe in Huawei. I also use Huawei for my mobile phone.
"The items are very good, but the price was reduced the next day after I bought it. Even if I insured the price, I won’t get anything. The seller is very nice."
I bought it for a colleague. The original eight-inch one was lost and I bought a new one.
"Timely delivery, good product, very satisfied"
"Bad review, the card cannot be inserted or pulled out. Since I have to disassemble the phone and replace the card slot at my own expense, does it mean that the card slot is broken if it cannot be pulled out?"
"Not bad. Huawei products are trustworthy. The more I use them, the more I like them."
You canceled my order inexplicably and put the responsibility on the customer when there is a problem. I don’t expect you to provide me with after-sales service. I have an unconditional negative review.
"After twists and turns, JD.com’s service is very good. The quality of Huawei is getting worse and worse. I don’t recommend everyone to buy it."
No invoice received
"The workmanship is excellent, there is no lag, and it is being used. I hope the battery lasts longer."
"It fluctuates every day, and it breaks down after more than a month. I have to return it to the factory. Bad review."
This phone is so rubbish. The image is so unclear that it hurts your eyes just looking at it. It can easily damage your eyes. Don’t buy it.
"I always buy Huawei mobile phones, they are trustworthy."
"It has fingerprint recognition and looks beautiful, but there will be lags and freezes. It is definitely not comparable to Apple, but the price is there and it is enough."
"Mengniu, you are so arrogant. . Mengniu again! china news network"
Negative reviews ignore customers!
"Good quality and low price. After looking at it for a long time, I finally chose this model. It is used for the elderly to watch news and TV series. I have tried it myself in the past few days. It is not bad and worth recommending."
Today I used a toilet stick to buy a large Mengniu fruit that I like to eat. . . So much fun. . . Suck it and go. . .
Evaluate after using it
The electrical appliances are simply defective. They don't plug in tightly and often don't work. Ten thousand negative reviews
"How do you say this? Well, the sound is quite good, and the edge is a little black and there is the memory. It feels like 16G is a bit smaller. It would be perfect if it has 32G."
Strength determines everything? Did everyone support Mengniu back then?
Such a company should let him die. A Mengniu manager was caught tampering with the production date
"The touch screen is not sensitive. It stopped working after using it for half a month after I bought it! ! ! Sure enough, you get what you pay for! ! ! !"
"After I got the Huawei tablet m3, it was exactly as I imagined. Beautiful. I like it."
"It’s okay, there’s nothing wrong with it! ! ! ! Discuss later"
It’s been a few days since I received the tablet and I’ve been using it pretty well. It’s great to watch videos.
Is there any problem if I drink Mengniu in the middle of the night? I actually think the packaging looks pretty good.
"Subtext, don’t be shameless and share NetEase News: Mengniu CEO: Production date tampering is an isolated case"
Delivery is fast
"Very clear, supports domestic production, very satisfied"
"Good quality, authentic!"
"It's okay, I like it"
"Hey, the Chinese men’s basketball team endorses Mengniu, no wonder it’s the worst in history~"
Not satisfied at all. Just got it and it dropped by 1*. I feel a bit cheated.
"not good! When I bought it, I was given a few accessories as gifts, including a computer stand, but I received nothing as a gift. I was disappointed. JD.com is not trustworthy. I had known that I had bought it at other stores with low prices and gifts."
"It's good or not, it's just the same as Huawei's more than a thousand mobile phones, except the screen is bigger. ."
"Suitable for learning, easy to use and practical, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"Cheap and good quality, worth buying. . ."
"Not bad, but I think it’s a bit small"
"The stuff is pretty good, but it’s even cheaper on Double Eleven, only 999."
Just got the goods. Don't know yet how effective it will be. But the express delivery is pretty good
I'll die if I don't drink Mengniu! !
"I was also drunk, and the price dropped by *RMB just one day away. It started slowly and I haven’t used anything else."
"Very good and powerful! It heats up quickly too! It can be kept warm for two days when the temperature is high and one day when it is cold. I use it with my hair wash, it’s so convenient!"
"It's so rubbish, it's unresponsive and the screen is blurry, I can't stand it. What makes me speechless the most is that in Honor of Kings, I can’t click on skills while holding down the key to move. I originally wanted to support domestic products. It chills me so much. It’s rubbish. I’ll still buy Apple products in the future."
"Mengniu real fruit grains real fruit + mellow milk! Perfect match, born to be a perfect match! Mengniu Zhenguoli invites you to experience the wonderful taste of a perfect match and share your beautiful mood! http:t.cn/zO5LPfb @mark"
"A large mobile phone comes with nothing. It’s a bit of a trap. The price is high. Can it be lower? We support domestic products, but you have to be worthy of consumers."
"Huawei's quality, beautiful appearance, smooth operation, fast logistics, online shopping on JD.com."
Doesn't it come with a protective case? Why is it bare metal? Isn't this deceiving consumers?
"The appearance is very exquisite, the box has a lid with a built-in protective film, but there are no headphones? Let’s review the machine after using it for a period of time."
I've been using it for a month with various crashes and various cards. angry.
"The machine is much more powerful, but I am not used to it without double-clicking to open the screen. JD Express is still very fast. The packaging is too simple, just like a fake. The machine inside can be taken out and replaced."
"Overall, I think it's pretty good. To compare the m3 with the ipad mini 4 is like comparing the p9p10 with the iPhone 7."
"Everyone says that Huawei's products are good, buy one and use it."
The memory is different from the actual one. I ran out of memory after downloading 30 episodes of the series.
"The current price is even cheaper than the flash sale, just one day away. I’m really speechless."
"When I watch the video, I can only see my own face. The picture quality is so bad. And the price was reduced to 666 right after I bought it."
"Boycott large domestic dairy companies, especially Mengniu and Yili. For the sake of you, me, and our children and grandchildren, boycott the unscrupulous big milk enterprises. The Ministry of Health does not care about hygiene"
It's good to use
"No, there's something wrong with the system. If you set the default storage as the memory card in the system, it is easy to have the memory card not being read. Restarting can solve the problem. I don't know if it is a system problem or a device problem."
The price dropped so soon? ? What's going on? Price 100
"Very useful, very powerful, and worth the money! Continue next time!"
The experience of using the software is really bad....
"Good sound quality, clear screen, great for watching movies."
"Mengniu, this is too bad! Boycott!"
Poor performance!
"Today’s breakfast was so satisfying! (Peach and plum hot dog buns + Shuanghui spicy meat pie + Belgian caramel biscuits + Mengniu sour yogurt strawberry flavor) Life is so complete! Hahaha, I was so happy that I couldn’t help but blow myself up again"
"Very good, for my mother to use, she likes it very much!"
The phone is just over a month old and it is experiencing various problems. The sound when answering calls is extremely quiet. The Wi-Fi connection was also unavailable. I took it in for repair today and the parts inside were all rusty. The technician said it was a refurbished machine! Strongly request return!
"It’s great to watch TV series on a small tablet, it’s great, the sound is loud enough, haha"
Do you want to? This is my favorite now! I think Mengniu is better.
A very easy-to-use Huawei tablet. All my friends are using this brand. It’s very good.
"It's been a while since I received the baby. I feel pretty good about using it. The gift is pretty good, but the gift leather case has been used up and is gone. I feel a little bit disappointed. It would be better if I had it?"
"I don’t say much, I think it’s rubbish and there are a lot of questions."
"Huawei products are the most rubbish electronic products I have ever used, bar none. Worse than a copycat phone."
"# Send an iPad to Mom and Dad# The prizes are awesome! For Mengniu, for prizes"
"I bought it for a friend. He told me that he would play games and use it to gain leverage. If he gave it, he would tell me whether he had given it or not, and he would give it a good review."
"Let me tell you, I fell in love with this drink after I came to Shanghai. There is also a Mengniu drink that looks like this. It’s a big bottle. I forgot the name. I’ve gained 7 pounds. I’m not going to lie to you."
Stay away from drugs and Mengniu. Do a small survey. How many children are still drinking Mengniu? !
Thank you for the Mengniu Super Sour Yogurt. Give me a lot of energy for the morning.
"It's very good. I bought it more than 3 months ago. I only reviewed it because of Jingdou, but the machine is really easy to use."
The gift was missed and the reissue was not smooth. It was delayed for a whole week and it still hasn’t arrived! Very unhappy.
"High cost performance, high quality and low price"
The mobile phone is average and the network is only 2G. The difference is huge.
"I am very satisfied with the tablet computer. It is clear and generous, and the sound quality is good. Overall it is very good. The only shortcoming is that there is no free film, so we have to come with it as an amateur, but the price is good!"
"Terrible experience. The hardware is passable, but the software is a piece of rubbish. The key is that every software update requires half a year of internal testing, which is much worse than Xiaomi. It is definitely a bad review."
So shameless. The melamine content does not meet Mengniu standards.
"Not bad, but it happened to be 618, and it took a bit long to receive the goods."
"I feel great, I will comment again later when there is no problem."
"There are scratches on the side of the phone, probably due to workmanship issues, and there are stains on the charging cable. I bought it for my dad, but I’m too lazy to return it."
The screen resolution is too poor and too laggy
"Slow response, frequent freezes, and screen freezes. I can only say that I am very dissatisfied!"
"Poor; the price was reduced the day after I bought it; nothing came except the charger; no earphone film; too bad, bad, bad, bad"
Mengniu Guanyi Milk is delicious!
"Originally, there were no requirements for a low-priced machine, but the screen and touch needed to be slightly better!"
"*Marine instant sale, I found out it was a scam, so I dropped the price in a few days*"
"I have received the tablet for a long time, and it is good to use. The difference between the wifi version and the call version is that one can insert a phone card and be used as a mobile phone, while the other cannot access the Internet without wifi."
I don’t want to give it even a star! The customer service is really not professional at all. Express garbage is dead. Just in Kunming itself. Walked for five days. I still come to the door-to-door area myself!
"I thought it was the same as an iPad, but it turned out to be just a big phone! It has nothing to do with tablets!"
"I bought it in the past, but the price dropped later. I was unhappy and wanted to curse... I didn’t even get a film!"
"Support China Dairy Industry, support Mengniu!"
good. . . . . . . . .
"Reply Don’t read! Anyway, I never drink Mengniu! ...Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu! I also advise you to resign from Mengniu as soon as possible to avoid your relatives and friends being embarrassed for you!"
"The first time I went to JD.com, the product arrived at 9:45 noon, the product was returned at 3:40 pm, and the phone couldn’t be turned on after two hours of charging!"
"The so-called things are not available, which really reduces consumers' trust in Huawei. If you don't have it, don't say it. Now it's nothing."
"I am so disappointed with the tablet. If you want to believe that it is cheap but not good, when I watch the video, the screen will automatically go black and then crash. In short, I am very dissatisfied. I contacted customer service, but the customer service did not reply to the message! ! ! !"
"It is recommended not to buy electronic products on JD.com because they will not issue invoices. I contacted customer service and called three times in 5 days. Each time they said it would be opened on the same day. However, it was never opened. I seriously doubt the integrity of the product."
"Very good, very good"
I don’t think I’d give it a single star! The battery is defective and the screen contacts are defective.
"I secretly think that even if the setting is not done well, even if there is hearing impairment, even if a few friends cannot set it up, we who do after-sales service should ask clearly first, and wait until the possibility of improper use by the customer has been ruled out before making any other comments. ?"
"I have been using it for a few days and it is better than the ipadmini I returned a few days ago. In the eye protection mode, my eyes will not get tired after using it for half an hour when the light is very dark at night. After confirming that it works well, I bought a new original leather case and am quite satisfied with it. Worth recommending!"
Everyone seems to be complaining about Mengniu Banana Milk. . . This is an era of money grabbing. . .
"Rubbish, it's so stuck,"
"The sound quality of Harman Kardon is good. The system can be upgraded to Android 6.0, which is unexpected. The black edges are just right to prevent accidental touches. The price/performance ratio is very high."
"The delivery was super fast. I received it the next day. After trying it for a few days, the Internet is very fast and the quality is absolutely amazing. I bought a wifi version. It has a nice appearance, a big screen and good sound effects. Not bad?"
"The sound quality is good, very good, and the screen is also very clear! Like it very much!"
JD.com’s self-operated delivery is fast and the quality is good
The charger won’t charge after five uses. Whose problem is it?
"Not bad, a tablet with good quality and cost-effectiveness!"
"Just eight days after buying it, the price dropped by 100 yuan, and the warranty period has just expired. I am really speechless?"
Not easy to use.
"The mobile phone is of average use, you can't play games, watch videos for a long time, and the screen is not big! Because the speaker on the back shell gets very hot and will be hot to touch!"
"After I paid the money, the customer service ignored me. The tablet felt like it was using up power very quickly and charging very slowly."
It's just a huge cell phone. The functions are quite complete. like. Five points of praise. Support domestic products. Connecting to the internet is very fast. My neighbor likes it and wants to buy another one.
"No, many games cannot be played"
"I bought the second one and am using both now. They are used to play games, some large-scale 3D games, everything is fine."
Is it high-definition? It's a lie. The resolution is so low that it's a bit bigger than a junk phone screen.
"The tablet runs very fast, watching movies is very clear, playing games without lag, especially the sound effect is very good."
Things are very good
The photography effect is not good and the images taken are not true.
"Not good, slow response, poor battery, glaring phone screen, not worth it"
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay"
"The mobile phone is okay, I bought it because I saw some freebies, but I didn’t see any of them, so I’m not satisfied."
"It's very good, very smooth, the screen display effect is very good, the sound is also good, and it is worthy of the price."
Why does Yilimeng cattle cause diarrhea after drinking it? Not importing milk? I'm not alone in this.
I'm quite satisfied with this product. I haven't played it yet. I'll review it in a few days. I like all the stuff on JD.com.
"So-so, completely disappointed with JD.com"
The price/performance ratio is really good
"It's so rubbish. After less than ten days of use, the motherboard broke. It was not dropped or bumped. The customer service actually said that it will not be returned or exchanged after seven days. However, consumers have to pay for quality issues. JD.com is simply cheating."
"It’s so wicked, why doesn’t Mengniu close down? ! ! Repost Weibo"
"I own a Huawei mobile phone and bought a Huawei tablet because of my trust. How can such quality and level of after-sales maintenance services compete with foreign companies? ! If the problem cannot be solved, I will report the problem to the 315 hotline."
The machine is good. The best thing about JD.com is that the logistics is super fast~~~~
"Things are just like this, you get what you pay for."
"Not bad, oh, pretty good, okay, haha, not bad, oh, pretty good, okay, haha, not bad, oh, pretty good, okay, haha."
I just received the product. I opened it and found a small hole in the tablet screen. I contacted the seller and said that I broke it myself and they would not exchange it. I hope you will not be deceived again.
It's okay. I just received it yesterday. There's nothing wrong with it. I'm using it for work. I'll see how it goes later.
It feels pretty good. I bought it yesterday and received it today. I like it very much.
"It's very good, very clear, and the screen is large and comfortable to look at."
"Jingdong’s self-operated products are great, even the mobile phones are not that good."
What kind of customer service is it? It’s so bad. It takes a long time to ask a question but doesn’t answer it. It’s rubbish.
"Thank you Mengniu Sour Yogurt for your support of #??#, I am very grateful!"
It's really rubbish. It's not even a big phone. There are fingerprints on the tablet. There's a lot of dust on the back film. There are also fingerprints. Someone has taken it. It's rubbish.
"They don’t even send headphones, which is too stingy, and the goods are not very good. mean"
"I give my heart to logistics, but the price was reduced just after I received it. I’m so depressed."
"The Fortune Edition comes with an Oriental Fortune app, but be careful not to turn it on casually, otherwise the VIP privileges will be lost. The phone has no instructions, Huawei Raj"
"It is mainly used for watching TV for children, and I don’t use it much for other functions. I don’t know whether it is good or not, but it is good for making phone calls. It can be used as a mobile phone in critical situations."
"Real goods, good quality and low price, great???"
"I picked it up myself, but when I went to the pick-up location, I found that the store was not open! There was a note posted at the door saying that we had to pick it up at another place. I was convinced. Why didn't anyone tell us in advance? It was a waste of time and energy to have to go to another place."
"Support Huawei more and more. The mobile phone used by the old man has not had any problems for several years, and the router has been replaced by a Honor one, which is very easy to use. This tablet is indeed very cost-effective and has exquisite workmanship. Although it is for my father, I sincerely support it!"
"Why is there not even a film on the screen, let alone a leather case? It’s really depressing!"
I have been paying attention to it for a long time and my wife is using it well. Make one myself.
"The size is weird, I can’t complain"
I love China and support Huawei. The quality is very good.
"There is only Mengniu yogurt in the break room. I don’t want to drink it, I still don’t drink it, I still don’t drink it."
What are you cutting? The electrical panel has stopped working after a month of use and cannot be charged.
"The 4G memory still has 2.8. If I use it for a week, it will remain around 2.0."
"Not bad, the price matches the actual product."
Not satisfied with the unclear screen. The photos taken by the camera are not as good as those of 2 million pixels. Charging is slow. One star for express delivery. Refund pending.
The baby still likes it very much after receiving it. It is a gift for the baby and he can’t put it down.
"The battery life is less than 9 hours, the short game time is less than 5 hours, and the system response is slow. I really didn’t expect that the Snapdragon 616 is so bad. It can’t carry a 1920x1200 screen. It’s a shame for a product like Huawei’s."
"The packaging is still very good. It would be perfect if there were bubble wrap protection between the outer box and the flat box during express delivery. The outer packaging looks okay, like a larger Huawei phone."
"I bought it for someone else, but I haven’t played it, so I don’t know how it feels! ! !"
This is already my second purchase.
"Not bad,,, very good."
"I just used it for a day and I think it’s pretty good. It looks pretty good. However, Huawei’s customer service and JD Express are so bad that I’m not satisfied!"
Why is Mengniu always in trouble? Serious boycott!
The effect is very good. Domestic products still need to be supported. This is the second time I have purchased it. It works well.
"The seller is so generous. He actually sold the phone, phone protective case, and film without giving anything away. It’s too bad."
Why did Mao lower the price as soon as he got the item? Why don’t you wait until I evaluate it before you lower the price? I really asked for this bad review.
"This phone is really mediocre, with low resolution and blurry photos. It’s a junk phone."
"*Yes, you will get a response when you make a call after buying it. . . Alas, no return. . . What a scam"
"I see a lot of photos showing headphones, selfie sticks, etc., but I don’t have any of them. Not long after I bought them, the price was reduced to 849."
The packaging is simple and the functions are convenient and easy to use. Worth having
I bought one for an old man to use WeChat. The screen is big so he can see it clearly!
"The stuff is pretty good, but the delivery didn't arrive on time. I'm so disappointed in my reputation!"
"The stuff is good, but JD.com’s service is terrible. It takes a long time to solve the problem, and it goes back and forth. If it can’t be delivered in time, what’s the point of choosing JD.com?"
"Products are regardless of nationality, and high quality and low price are the first criteria. Compared with Japanese products, toxic and harmful products and fake and shoddy products should be boycotted more. Sanlu and Mengniu have damaged so many people's health, shouldn't they be boycotted?"
Pretty good configuration!
"The tablet looks beautiful, has excellent product performance, is well packaged, and has fast delivery! Good reviews"
"Very good, the tablet looks good, the operating system is smooth, and there is no lag"
"Oh my god, don’t be greedy for such a small bargain. It’s really rubbish. I only used it a few times and it couldn’t be turned on or charged. There was also a big mark on the screen. I was really disappointed."
"I drank two cups of Mengniu pure milk with sugar and sugar today. It tasted good, not bad."
"The courier boy has a bad review, a bad review, a bad review, a bad review! After buying things from JD.com for so many years, this is the first time I encountered a courier who didn’t even enter the community gate."
"The worst experience was that the charging head sent was broken and could not be charged. There was no direct store nearby, and the customer service staff actually asked me to send the entire phone back. I was speechless about this crappy phone. Throw away the charger and buy again"
"Not bad, the kids like it very much, and the logistics is great."
Baby is fine! Like it very much! Express delivery is also very good! Got it in just one day! Thank you so much
Very good! I quite like it! What a deal! The sound is really good!
"There's a flaw here, and that's the resolution. Watching Youku, there is a virtual image."
"There is nothing wrong with the items, but they are not given any stickers as promised, nothing is sent to them, and there are no gifts."
"The phone case is obviously *$*. Now that the shell is gone, drop *. This is obviously a bundled sale. Rubbish Jingdong."
"I just want to say that even an ear wire is not worthy of you, how can you deceive people at all, bad reviews, bad reviews, JD.com’s products are becoming more and more untrustworthy."
"Sorry, the delivery is wrong."
"It's really good, the size is good, and the screen is quite clear!"
"The promotion of giving away leather cases is just a gimmick. Is everyone’s response saying that the giveaway is over? How infuriating. I can’t bear the deception, I would have bought someone else’s product if you told me, bad review!"
Not bad. It supports Huawei and there is no problem in using it.
"The rear camera often fails to focus, and even scanning QR codes is a headache."
"Watching TV, playing games, good. Especially express delivery, super five-star service, the speed is also excellent"
"Very good, it feels good and clear after applying it!"
"Fast delivery, received it the next day, very useful."
"The express delivery was too slow and I didn't even get it, so I just said I had to sign for it. I'm very dissatisfied"
The complaints are too cruel... What kind of shame do Mengniu’s senior executives have in this world?
The touch screen doesn’t work! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Don't care about anything
I just tried Mengniu’s milk and it tastes very good. Today I am working with Mengniu milk and bought a big bag of various kinds haha
Don’t you know why you are dissatisfied? ?
"I can’t connect to WIFI after I bought it. To be honest, it’s a pity. I originally planned to support domestic products, but I was very disappointed."
"The items are okay, but the seller is so disappointing. They asked me to buy them when they were out of stock. After I bought them, they told me they were out of stock. Haha."
"Profiteers, profiteers! Is this Mengniu Ice+? ? #Camera360PhotoSharing#"
"Not bad, cost-effective, very suitable as a backup machine..."
"I think this tablet is pretty good. The system runs smoothly, the screen quality is great, I can listen to music without headphones, and the external sound quality is good."
"I'm not using it myself, but people who have used it haven't had any bad feedback, so it should be fine."
It's stuck and crashes frequently.
"Garbage, the pixels are terrible. Not even a pair of headphones. I really want to return it! Just for the sake of the courier guy, forget it."
The Mengniu one makes me feel helpless. . All kinds of intelligence that cannot be seen directly! !
"After using it, it starts to freeze and the left and right sliding is slow. Visual inspection of the second-hand phone is undoubtedly. Don’t come to JD.com to buy anything, it’s even worse than Tao Bao! Think clearly before buying"
"Not bad,,,,,"
"The quality is no problem, genuine, the price is average!"
The quality of domestic Huawei products is still good
"Supporting domestic products must also be treated differently. Huawei can do it, but Mengniu can never"
I received instant likes on the same day I took the photo
"The item is good, but the price was reduced as soon as I got it. I’m so sad. Isn’t there a 30-day price guarantee?"
"Mengniu Guanyi Milk protects the health and beauty of millions, hahaha"
"For company use, the quality is good, very good"
"To be honest, I’m not even willing to send one as a gift. Seriously, I don’t want to say more."
My dad said he was not very satisfied and it was only worth more than three hundred.
"A good tablet, especially the sound quality"
"It's so good to use, I can't take pictures of myself"
"I can’t even scan the QR code, the pixels are too poor! The same picture is very clear on other phones, but it's all blurry on this one! I regret it so much!"
"mutual encouragement! Hmm... You are not normal consumers. I don’t eat meat products from Shuanghui, I don’t drink Yili and Mengniu, and now I won’t drink any domestic red wine or white wine. I wonder if I am qualified and normal?"
"The product is good, I will review it after using it! I don’t know about the quality."
"I just bought a box of yoghurt, and when I took out the small box, it was rotten. I just hope that the quality inside is not to die for. The quality of your small box is also so bad, I swear I will never buy it again# Mengniu #, completely disappointed"
"The flat screen is clear, runs smoothly, and the dual stereo speakers sound great!"
"Mengniu has changed its packaging, it looks great!"
Reply Respect Mengniu’s attitude. I hope Mengniu can truly make good products and be worthy of the trust of the people. Mengniu benefits
"Very poor, much longer than the flat plate,"
"Jingdong is such a piece of rubbish. I have always believed in them, but they actually sell second-hand mobile phones with white barcodes on the back and photos of other people on the phone when they are turned on. It looks like you won’t be able to buy things on JD.com in the future."
"I still think Tianyou’s red date sour wheat tastes good, Yili’s is not fragrant enough, Mengniu’s is too sweet, Xuebao’s is too sour..."
"Good, good, good, good. . . . . ."
"It’s ok, there’s no difference as expected!"
"I have always trusted JD.com, with first-class logistics, first-class products, first-class reputation and good reviews."
"The light sensor is terrible, it's very dark automatically. The screen isn't clear enough either. Battery life is short. Huawei's system is not ideal and is obviously not as convenient as Xiaomi and ZTE. This tablet is only so-so for watching movies and not ideal for playing games."
"It’s so cold, suddenly I feel that Mengniu is so warm! Mengniu Mengniu"
"The mobile phone is OK, but no invoice is issued."
"Not good at all, it’s really bad. It takes too long to charge and consumes too much power. It’s still in smart power-saving mode, and it still consumes too much power. It’s really bad~"
"I bought two models of this model. The first time I got a film, but the second time I didn’t."
Woohoo~~~My Mengniu Youyi c! ! Finally bought a bottle. Spread half of it for me!
"Attractive, scary big phone, compact tablet, very good, eager to continue to use it"
I just started using it. I used Samsung before and it was so cool. I support domestic products.
"It's okay, it looks good, and its performance is much better than that of Xiaomi. It's my first time using Huawei's products, so I trust JD.com!"
Fighter in the garbage. The signal is not good and the connection keeps getting disconnected. Really unusable.
"Mengniu's gutter milk contains aflatoxin that exceeds the standard! , it is easy to cause cancer. I bought three 1L bottles in my dormitory. A conscientious company."
"Not bad, pretty, good quality and cheap."
"Mengniu, you taste so bad"
"Average, average, too average."
How many cows does Mengniu have now? I want to visit Mengniu’s breeding farm. Can I go freely?
"I received it and have been using it for two days. It works fine for playing games, watching movies, watching TV, reading information, listening to music, and using Bluetooth."
My phone keeps overheating and shuts down automatically.
"Oops, even video chatting will freeze! I don’t want to give it even one star! ! !"
"Average, slow response"
Mengniu wants to be happy. . .
"I bought it for an elderly person at home. He liked it so much that he asked me to change the card and use it. I carry it with me wherever I go, haha?"
Not so good! card machine
"Being able to say such a thing proves this simple equation: failure to ensure consistent action = shameless! Mengniu = cannot guarantee consistent actions, so: Mengniu = shameless!"
"Google was fined hugely by the Federal Trade Commission, but people thought the fine was too small and had no disciplinary effect. Shuanghui and Mengniu, therefore, mainland China will not produce global companies."
"I just started using it, I hope the quality is okay."
"When I bought it, I only read what others said about it being useful for my mother. I also bought one for my dad. The icons on the screen are still too small for the elderly who have poor eyesight. The two cards are too small and are not as big as the two original cards. The edge of the phone is too thin and half of the edge is round."
"Not bad, very good. I bought it for the second time."
We support domestic products and sincerely hope that everyone can use domestic brands.
It took 5 days to arrive. Jingdong is really. Nothing but tablet and charger. Not to mention giveaways. Basic membranes don't. Neither do headphones.
I spent 9.3 yuan on two boards of Mengniu Youyi C at night. Happy and cheap.
I really like Mengniu’s advertisements
"I bought it because there were gifts, but when I came back there was nothing. The supplier said it was expensive at the time and that the gifts had been sold out. I feel very unhappy."
The express delivery is super fast and arrives the next day. I always use Huawei and support domestic products.
"The price drop is too bad, the 30-day guaranteed price is written as nonsense, and the customer service is terrible."
"I bought it at an event price, and it’s cost-effective. The sound quality of the tablet is okay, and the workmanship is okay. Overall, it’s good."
"Yes, it's very useful."
"Mengniu's changes and initiative to cater to consumers this time are very wise. When it comes to food safety, only by apologizing, showing a sincere attitude and taking active and effective actions can we win the trust of consumers."
"When I buy it for my grandpa, I can rest assured when I choose JD.com. Customers, if you see my review, please contact me. I want to issue an invoice. How can I guarantee the warranty if I don’t have an invoice?"
I don’t know why I’m playing the coc cr mobile game on this tablet right next to the router. The Wi-Fi signal is intermittent. I’m depressed.
"The delivery is very fast, but the head of the charger seems to be wrong, it does not feel original, and the memory is only 11G. It is not a happy purchase."
The courier is very bad! He actually asked me to get it! Very bad attitude! The tone is very bad! Very irresponsible! Delivered to me 4 hours late! Worst courier ever!
"Average, not very good, not smooth to use. Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey"
"Every bit of happiness starts with New Mengniu! New Mengniu, new atmosphere!"
"You get what you pay for, very stuck"
The two bottom corners of the screen are uneven. I replaced a few tempered films and put them on and the two bottom corners are warped. Huawei has such poor workmanship. I might as well buy Xiaomi.
"Anyway, Mengniu is rubbish and I have stopped drinking Inner Mongolia milk for a long time."
The pixels are terrible and the price was reduced as soon as I bought it!
"Nice tablet, especially at this price"
Strongly request Mengniu Yili Sanlu to come here! . This is the truth. From: http:t.cn/zYTaJ4D
This tablet is really not worth it and is below Huawei’s standards.
"The body is bent, don’t buy it"
"This tablet from Huawei is really good. It’s easy to use, feels good, and is very thin. However, it’s a little expensive and relatively sturdy. The price fluctuates around 100 yuan. Overall, a very satisfying shopping."
Things are not very good
"Very practical! The price is okay! I'm just not satisfied with the clarity. After all, the resolution is there."
"Absolutely bad review, the price was reduced when I bought it, and the warranty failed. It’s really disgusting."
"The highlight of the Premium Edition Wifi Tablet is the strong Wi-Fi signal, but the actual test results are not as disappointing as a mobile phone with a few hundred yuan. Is the merchant cheating? Look at the actual test site photos (taken at different times)."
The tablet broke in less than two months. The bottom looks like it is falling apart. The screen is black and cannot be turned on.
The screen failed after less than three months of use.
"The standby time is good, I bought it for my dad to play Landlord, and it is smooth to use."
The free data card broke within two days. . Money is also wasted. . I don’t know who to contact for after-sales service. . .
It's very good. My mother likes it very much and can surf the Internet and read novels.
"There are no gifts, it’s such a scam"
The stuff is pretty good and the courier guy has a great attitude!
"This is totally a lie. The logistics is extremely slow. The delivery guy’s service is not bad. He promised that the order would arrive the next day, but it took several days for it to arrive."
"No, it seems to be a fake. It gets hot after playing and charging."
"I just got it today and tried it out. I just downloaded software and didn’t play games. In less than half an hour, half of the phone was so hot that I didn’t dare to touch it. It’s really a combination of ice and fire."
The only thing is that the operating habits are different (everyone feels it)
Only when I bought this tablet did I realize that it did not come with a leather case. It was written online that it came with a leather case and a film. I informed the customer service about the situation. Customer service said no. Then why is it written in red letters on the Internet that you will get 2 special stickers for the special leather case?
"Thick vanilla, my favorite is Mengniu Milk Special@Mengniu Micro Customer Service"
"Well, I generally won't boycott a company, except for garbage like Mengniu that can't stand up to the wall. Dell is temporarily removed from the blacklist to see the effect"
It's very bad. The machine smells like plastic when I use it.
It took me a while to evaluate it. It’s pretty good. Domestic tablets are not bad either. I hope more people will support domestic products.
It's so stuck. How did you get those good reviews? Did those who gave the good reviews receive any benefits? You're talking without conscience. It's so stuck. Don't be fooled again! ! !
"The plane that came over in the morning must have been shot down. It rushed through the clouds and suddenly hit the ground and landed. Mengniu yogurt is also served, and I have been worried about whether I will feel sick after eating it. . ."
"I found some Deluxe milk produced by Mengniu and fiddled with it for a while and found out... Compared to Asahi Vipshop, the foaming volume is slightly less, the sweetness is stronger, and the milk foam is also very stable. They are much better than Nestlé Mengniu."
Mengniu is so disgusting. The picture produced on February 30th is definitely not fake. What does it mean that the content is untrue?
Nice product.
I have bought several from JD.com. The quality of JD.com is trustworthy.
"I really don’t understand, after all this, there are still people drinking Mengniu? ! If you don't drink milk, you will die. Repost Weibo"
"The delivery person's service is very good, and the items are good to use."
WiFi is unreliable and Internet access is limited.
Mengniu red beans have changed their packaging and are still as delicious!
"The delivery speed is very fast, but the packaging is too poor. The packaging is very damaged after arrival. The courier is indifferent and the service is poor and unprofessional."
"Needless to say, it is totally worth the price of 1888, and it is much better than the previous generation m2. If you give it a good review, it will depend on whether there will be problems in the future. I trust Huawei."
It took me a few days to evaluate it. Huawei is really good.
People from HK don’t really like it! Mengniu drank too much
"Recently I fell in love with it, Mengniu women's milk powder plus Nescafé black coffee. Just with the steamed buns, it tastes good."
"I received this big blue box and was surprised when I opened it. It is both a computer and a mobile phone, killing two birds with one stone."
"The appearance is so beautiful, just what I wanted. It feels good in my hand and the weight is just right. But there is nothing that comes with it. Alas."
"Shipping was fast. I don’t really like Huawei’s system at first, but it’s for the elderly, so it saves me the trouble."
I regret it. It’s specially made for children to watch videos. Charging is slow. The gravity sensor error always goes upside down during videos. Charging is extremely slow. Very slow.
"Mengniu is so creative and careful, haha"
"Next, I exchanged the goods, and I didn’t receive the goods until March 10th. I really can’t praise this kind of efficiency: JD.com clearly sent the wrong goods, so why should consumers bear the loss?"
"It's very easy to use, high-definition, ultra-thin, and runs fast. My suggestion is not to upgrade the system. Once the system is upgraded to a higher level, the configuration will not match and it will easily slow down."
nice one. . . . . .
Nice stuff! ! For dad to play poker! ! Good quality and low price! ! ! Like it! ! ! !
"The Android system is very convenient to use, but there are much fewer dedicated software than IPAD."
It’s pretty good. I’ll review it after using it.
"I don’t want to give a single evaluation, but I must choose one among the evaluations! So bad!"
"A great phone tablet, I got it at a special price of 618, and it arrived in the afternoon. Highly praised?"
The resolution is not high! Huaping appears all the time
It's garbage. It's a waste of money. I suggest you don't buy it.
"Huawei's domestically produced high-quality products, with bright colors and fast response times, are the tablets I am most satisfied with."
"Nice phone, very good"
"I bought it at 618, it’s good, it’s worth the price, the sound quality is decent, and the sound is loud enough. Huawei is trustworthy, fast, no lag when playing with pesticides, and the system is smooth."
"Every time one of the promotional gifts is out of stock, there are four types of gifts shown, but one is unavailable every day, which feels a bit deceptive. JD.com disappointed me for the first time."
"There is something wrong with us, but there is nothing wrong with Mengniu and Yili! share pictures"
"It’s old, refurbished, and there are old photos. I’m so angry. I originally believed in JD.com, but now I can only hehe."
Drink at home and get a home card lesson uh uh uh
"Very good, good for watching TV and playing games"
Mengniu is about to go against the grain
The baby likes it very much and is very satisfied with the shopping.
I think the reason why I have been having diarrhea today is because of the Mengniu you gave me this morning. Don’t drink Mengniu from now on! It’s really a sin to drink at night when you have diarrhea.
"I feel that the prices on JD.com are too inflated. A mobile phone with more than 1,000 yuan can cost up to several hundred dollars. The profit is huge."
It feels good and responds quickly. It’s worth owning.
"I bought another box of Mengniu, which is affordable and supplements calcium."
"For general use, mainly for children to play with"
Junk Jingdong
Watching TV is smooth
"The picture is not clear, no different from a mobile phone"
"I don’t know when it will be upgraded to mui5.1. The system is still not very easy to use. I only scored over 50,000 points in the Entertainment Rabbit test. The gpu is a bit stuck at 1980×1080 resolution. The battery still lasts about ten hours."
It’s really nice. It’s well made. The screen is clear and the speed is not laggy.
"Very good, very good, quite smooth. For the first time, I feel the feeling of the game being loaded first."
Easy to crash
"Received, the item is very good. The memory is just a little small, so you can buy a memory card if it’s not enough. Not bad, I like it?"
"Support domestic products, large size, very convenient for watching TV and movies"
Everyone has seen the Mengniu top three meeting last time. This time we still have to work hard to the end... We will not lose in the battle between popularity and popularity.
"I haven’t used it yet, I didn’t even get a tablet case as a gift."
"When I bought it, I was promised that 4G would run 32G memory, but now 3G runs 16G memory!"
"Ah! I also dress very happily. Drinking Mengniu causes cancer, and the clothes I wear cause cancer! The world is such a mess!"
"Recently, I love Mengniu’s oatmeal + yellow peach yogurt. . Will drinking too much cause brain damage?"
"Not easy to use, easy to crash"
Mengniu's forage transportation trades cost for safety.
"Continue to resist. If Chinese people don’t buy Japanese goods, the island country will not be unable to do so. If Chinese people don’t buy Mengniu, they will soon be unable to do so. One less harm is one."
"Great value for money, a tablet worth owning! My wife likes it very much!"
"It's not that good, and it's always hot. I don't have a mobile phone number, and it's not so serious when I get drunk or play games and get hot. The only good thing is that it’s not stuck, maybe it’s a new phone."
"Eating old yogurt has made me smarter. Mengniu, look how much I support you."
"Timmao is still reliable for online shopping. The price dropped* just a few days after I bought it. If we don’t get a full refund of the price difference, do we have to return it and place a new order? You don't mind it's troublesome, but we think it's delaying things~"
"You idiots who are calling for a boycott of Japanese goods, did you drink Mengniu today?"
"It's okay, I'm quite satisfied with it."
"This is my second purchase, mainly because of Huawei's popularity. The price is 1,000 yuan and it runs quite smoothly. Overall, it's pretty good."
It broke after only one day. . . The screen suddenly flickers.
"The tablet is pretty good, but it’s expensive. A few days after I bought it, the price was reduced for a limited time. I felt a little bit shortchanged."
"I wanted to issue an invoice, but the invoice was not issued to me! Contact them, they told me, contact JD!"
"Not good. If you buy it, it will be reduced. I won’t dare to buy it on JD.com in the future."
I just want to know why there is no Jingdong Dou after I bought so many things.
"The sound effect is great, whether listening to headphones or playing outside, especially when turned on, it is simply shocking. The size is comfortable, the screen is exquisite, it is very enjoyable to watch movies, the battery life is good, and the performance is the best choice among Android tablets at this price."
"It will be very fast, Dad said yes."
"Very good, very satisfied, very good ah ah ah ah"
"Affordable price, good quality, highly recommended."
"Knowing that I like White Rabbit candy the most, as well as Mengniu real fruit strawberry flavor, I went shopping at Dazhong and even made a special trip to buy it for me and deliver it to my house downstairs."
"Yes, you can buy something like this at this price. It’s not bad. It’s much better than I imagined. The system is also smooth. I recommend it."
"I really want to cry. I just bought it and the price was reduced by * yuan the next day. It’s so disgusting. Jingdong, I’m almost depressed."
It would be great if this food became popular. I wonder if Mengniu should do this project?
"I haven't received the invoice yet, are you a liar? I left my contact number and no one contacted me. Ten thousand people are dissatisfied."
It’s so rubbish. There are no negative reviews for the headphones.
JD.com’s self-operated logistics is super bad
"It’s a crappy thing that can’t be used, the resolution is pretty low, and my glasses hurt after looking at them for a while. Cheap but no good goods"
"I also resigned naked and resigned from the expectations of many people. Where did I get the courage and perseverance in those years? Thank you Brother Wang, thank you Mengniu"
"Don't do this to deceive people. The memory stated on the website is 16g. When I took it apart and looked at it, I found that it was only 11g. Are there still 5g memory that you have eaten? And they don’t give away anything. There is no screen film either. A failed purchase."
Why can’t I turn on my mobile phone after a few days after I bought it? Can I exchange it?
I only bought it two days ago and the price dropped*! What the hell! Bad review! I don't want to give it even one star!
"There is no free gift, I was cheated."
"I think Mengniu Big Fruit is the real big fruit, and it’s much more filling than Guangming~"
"One big problem? ! How can we not control it if there is a monitoring mechanism? Establish a CEO responsibility system, and if an accident occurs and the CEO is imprisoned, there will be no problems. Resist firmly! #food??# Is Mengniu’s entire industrial chain completely out of control?"
I also boycott Mengniu and will never buy a man who is attracted by Mengniu!
"In addition, to be honest, the flat jacket recommended by JD.com is really scummy, and I don’t know how the corners were broken."
The delivery guy is awesome! There will be a webmaster of the same kind as there are employees. makes me angry
"It was my first time to buy something from JD.com. I bought it after seeing good reviews. I didn’t expect that the screen was unclear, not smooth, and the response was too slow. When buying a mobile phone, you have to go to a physical store to check it out and try it yourself."
The quality of the product is very good. Jingdong Logistics is very good. I have been using it for almost two months and there are no problems. It is a good purchase!
Heartless Jingdong! ! !
I’m super happy if I can’t drink Guangming Paper House but can drink Mengniu! ! ! (?_? I can’t talk nonsense about things like kneeling down and begging for help!)
This is my first time buying from Huawei. It feels great to use and it feels great to use. I can watch videos and make calls very well. I haven't found any problems like the sound jamming that others mentioned.
"Mengniu, you are so shameless"
"The battery drained very quickly, and I had to charge it after making four or five calls. It was very troublesome. I always say that Huawei's quality is good, but I was really disappointed this time."
"It's okay to use it now, okay"
"This time, I am mainly dissatisfied with logistics. JD.com’s “next-day delivery” is a joke."
"I just received the goods and have used it for a while. It is ok. The logistics is super fast. JD.com is trustworthy. It’s worth buying at this price, China Huawei supports domestic products."
"Watching videos and playing mini games is enough. Not bad, come on!"
I feel very good after receiving it. It is better than what I am using now. I gave it to my mother. I think she will like it.
The courier arrived for delivery. It took two days to deliver. I was so depressed.
Such a rich breakfast and Mengniu yogurt told me: I am really back!
"To be honest, I lost 100 yuan within 10 days of purchasing the goods. During the five-day holiday, I didn’t even look at the goods. . . The price guarantee is 7 days. . . Count yourself on the back. The courier guy is nice."
I will kill you if I issue an invoice. I have to issue an invoice. JD.com is getting more and more rubbish. I am a diamond member and I am planning to stop buying things on JD.com.
"Everyone likes to eat whatever they want, how can Mengniu do it..."
"This thing is so bad. I bought it and it didn’t work for a few days. When I tried to use it, I found that the screen kept getting stuck."
The tablet is not bad! Express delivery is also very good!
"The motherboard broke just after the 15-day replacement period, and there was an endless wait for repairs."
"I'm not using it myself, so it should be fine. I'm not saying it won't work."
"It feels good, the battery life is very good, and other functions are also good. I bought it to play games. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that there are no headphones, a sheath, and the appearance."
"I placed the order in the morning and received it in the afternoon. It took me a few days to review it, except that the resolution was a little off. Performance in other aspects is relatively good. This price is definitely worth buying! ! !"
The order was placed at 9am and received at 6pm. It was so fast. Baby has powerful functions and the screen size is just right. Like it very much!
Is it okay to use it?
"It is said to be a calling tablet, but it does not have the function of inserting a SIM card. Bad review, bad review"
"This was designed by some idiot Huawei engineer. The SIM card and TF card share the same card slot, and the two SIM cards are different in size."
"We agreed on 32G of memory, but it only has 12G and only comes with a charger. Send nothing"
"Believe in JD.com, believe in Huawei, and believe in yourself!"
I received the tablet and used it for a day before commenting. The overall feeling is pretty good. I personally think it is easier to use than Apple. It supports domestic products.
"I don’t know where it got so many good reviews, or maybe I was just unlucky and got a broken phone. The picture is not clear at all, and the characters in movies and TV series are all blurry."
"Mom, Mengniu has replied to me. It seems that I can no longer speak ill of others."
"Not great, the response is a bit slow!"
Mengniu launches banana milk and it tastes pretty good
"I have already bought one, and once again I went shopping on JD.com, and it was very useful. ?"
So fast. Now you are wearing a coat. Your super domineering Mengniu!
"Yes, the best thing is that there are two speakers that can listen to the left and right."
Just received the goods and I feel pretty good! Bought for my children and my wife to play with! Please review after using it
"The machine is not smooth at all, the response is slow, the screen display effect is average, and overall it is average"
"If you don’t drink Mengniu all the time, you can taste the low quality in your mouth."
"I bought it for a friend and gave it to a customer, I think he will be satisfied. . . . . ."
The logistics speed is really fast. I got it in less than a day. It can also be used on a tablet. There is no lag at all when playing games. It’s really fun to play.
The goods have been received. It is for office use. It feels good and the delivery speed is fast. I will wait for a while to comment on the performance.
"I gave it a try as soon as I got it, and it works fine. Overall, I'm quite satisfied."
arrogant arrogant arrogant arrogant arrogant arrogant
"My parents’ mobile phone has been used for a long time, so I bought one for her."
"Can't open it just after use, so I suspect it's not genuine."
"What about gifts? There is nothing, something is wrong."
The most rubbish purchase ever. This is the first time I have never given a negative review.
"The tablet that arrived this afternoon was packed with rubbish. Fortunately, the screen was not broken, and there was no invoice voucher. JD customer service could explain why there is no invoice voucher. How will the warranty be maintained in the future?"
"The first one cost 1,999 yuan, and now the second one costs 999 yuan, which is lower than the price on Huawei’s official website. Of course, the most important thing is that the phone is reliable in quality, runs fast, has a big screen, and is great!"
"The tablet is very beautiful, I like it very much, gift it to my baby for his birthday 1,,,,,,,,,,"
Mengniu who listened to the monster teacher for two classes. . . . Disgusting... What's so good about Mengniu?
"They don’t even send a sticker. All the stores are closed during the Chinese New Year. Where can I apply the sticker? When the Chinese New Year is over, I’m worried that the screen the children are playing with will be scratched."
"A must-have if you love face. This one tastes pretty good. The milk taste is very pure. Skin care is a must. The best time to eat yogurt is at night. But on a bright morning, it’s very artistic with a cup of Mengniu Pure Yogurt."
"False propaganda and suspicion of deception: I promised that I would receive 60 coupons within 24 hours of signing, but it turned out that it has been 80 hours and there is still no trace. The customer service is still self-indulgent. Very disappointed"
It is no longer stupid to be stupid enough to drink Mengniu now. Is an accomplice. Help this shameless criminal continue to exist and poison more people.
The best of rubbish
"Except that it is not fully connected, everything else is pretty good."
Too bad. I haven’t used it for a month and I can’t use it anymore.
"Very good, the Internet speed is fast. Especially the sound effect is really good. Support domestic production. The perfect choice for watching movies and listening to music. Good reviews."
The one star is for the delivery. I haven’t used the tablet yet. I don’t know why Huawei doesn’t even have an invoice. Rongfu asked me to download the invoice...
Pay attention to what happened to your colleagues. I despise Mengniu. I haven’t bought Mengniu products in more than a year.
"The phone is a bit curved, very disappointing, Huawei"
The invoice has the wrong title and cannot be reissued. Check the review.
"What are you doing? I bought a gold one and a silver one was given to me, thinking that I am color blind."
People love to drink Mengniu Sour Yogurt. Are you looking for a wheel? The one above is much more handsome
Why is it so hard to buy ice cream in the winter in the South? I miss the feeling of eating ice cream around the fire! Yili and Mengniu are my favorites. We'll see you soon!
The body is severely bent under very careful use! ! The after-sales service is irresponsible and is artificial. I will never trust Huawei again! ! !
You get what you pay for. The resolution is not high and cannot be compared with the resolution of ordinary mobile phones nowadays.
I am stuck after using it. I really like it.
"Trash, no protective film"
"It is cost-effective, the system runs smoothly, and is sufficient for daily office use. Of course, add a memory card yourself"
"It was defective when I first got it back. After using it for a while, the sound disappeared and I was speechless."
"Very good, the size is right, the aspect ratio is also right, the screen is very clear, but the packaging protection is not very good when it is sent, please pay attention in the future"
Internet access is fast and easier to use than Xiaomi's.
"I really don’t dare to drink Mengniu anymore = = Ouch, you are in tragedy again"
"I can't play it, it's not worth the price, it always freezes, and the touch screen is not sensitive. I feel like I bought a copycat product."
Very good. Converts fruit powder into pollen. Supports Huawei.
"The mobile phone is terrible, very laggy, the mobile phone charger broke after a month and a half of use, and now it only takes an hour to charge 1% of the battery, and the battery is not durable."
Taking pictures is terrible
The quality of Mengniu's milk is really great. The attitude of Hemeng Niu is really the explanation for the success of Mengniu brand.
It was slow to start up. I was scared when I turned it on for the first time after receiving the product.
"I bought the machine on June 18th, but it broke on September 19th and could not be turned on."
"Nowadays, children are using more and more deceptive ways to commit suicide. Drinking too much Mengniu"
"Not great. I thought it was a tablet, but it turned out to be a mobile phone. I was very disappointed."
I am drinking Mengniu. Will it cause cancer? I am so scared~~~
There are too many reasons for bad reviews
"Good service attitude, nice baby, all 5 points."
"I bought this for my grandma. The screen response is relatively fast, but it doesn’t have its own film, which is weird!"
I hope Mengniu Yili will enter the international market and set a cheating price (???)
Satisfied. It’s a good phone. It’s the one I like.
"At this price, it’s a great value for money, and it’s a good equipment for my mother to watch TV dramas."
Tablet has powerful performance and is easy to use
"The price on JD.com is terrible, and the price dropped by 200 every 12 hours. The phone is good for the time being."
"Just received it, started using it, downloaded the file successfully, the speed is very fast, great."
This Huawei machine can make phone calls. It is actually very convenient to install a SIM card for Internet use.
"Very beautiful, easy to use and very cost-effective. know to have"
The battery doesn’t last long. It took me so long to comment after buying it.
"The price is high and the quality is questionable. No matter what you do, the sound takes nearly half a minute to come out."
"I bought it to play Honor of Kings, but the experience of playing Honor of Kings is not very good. When I use flash to chase someone, I will run back, wasting my flash. Many times I moved uncontrollably while chasing people."
"The product is okay, but I don’t know why there is no invoice? ????"
"It’s not great, the resolution is very low, and it’s very laggy. Don't buy it."
"The packaging is too simple. Can JD Express take some responsibility? Is the courier guy okay? I haven’t used it yet, I’ll add comments after I do."
Good quality and low price. Fast delivery. I bought this for my mother. She likes it very much. Good review.
It was delivered 20 hours after placing the order. Awesome logistics! It took a few days to evaluate.
"Everyone, please don’t buy this. As soon as you buy it, it always freezes. You can’t even take screenshots. You always have to shut down and restart the phone. If you contact customer service, they will directly refer you to after-sales service. I’m speechless."
"Consumers can’t even resist boycotting Mengniu, so what’s the point of boycotting Japanese products?"
I bought it yesterday and it arrived today. It's super fast. The machine feels very thin and light. The stereo sound effect is very good.
Not bad and the express delivery service is very fast. I took the photo today and it will arrive tomorrow.
Then destroy Mengniu. Then I want to destroy other people’s companies @LuluLucas
"Huge profits? Violence! Anyway, I basically don’t drink milk anymore, especially Yili and Mengniu."
"The phone box has no plastic film or anti-counterfeiting seal, the charger has no packaging, and most importantly, there is no instruction manual. The phone still works and I don’t bother to replace it."
"I like it. I bought it for my son to watch videos. It’s good. Very fast, no lag! ! It feels great, I like it, and I haven’t had any bad issues after using it for so long! Still pretty good! ! !"
I purposely didn’t buy one with a call function. The screen is clear. Watching movies on Sohu Video is very smooth without any lag. Watching videos and chatting on WeChat is basically satisfying!
"It's a bit stuck, but it's not a big problem. It's already very good to set the price."
"It doesn’t work very well, the battery doesn’t work, and it doesn’t work well!"
"Garbage, the operation is not smooth and the video cannot be downloaded."
One star for the courier guy. I haven’t played it for long after I bought it. I was playing a game and the touch screen went out of control. How do I play?
"Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu. Alas, the pride of the past is now the shame... I won’t buy it. Many friends and colleagues around me have stopped buying the Meng X brand for a long time. Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu"
"The packaging was smashed, and there wasn’t even enough cushioning protection inside. JD.com is so awesome! Not suitable for Huawei headphones. despise"
"Good stuff, it’s really good to use, the brand is pretty good, it’s simpler and easier to use than Apple’s, the system is optimized, and it’s easy to get started."
All the people in our school are so high-end! ! ! ! Do you still remember the uncle who spoke fluent and authentic English when you went to pick up the express delivery that day? ! ! Mengniu Mall is lurking with all kinds of highly intelligent store owners who have returned from studying abroad! ! ! !
Very good. My son is very satisfied and likes it.
The stuff is really good. Watching movies and playing games is great. A very pleasant shopping. Not stuck at all.
"Support domestic products! Huawei's products are becoming more and more sophisticated and beautiful, so who else can we give them to?"
I bought this tablet for my younger brother. I’m so excited to get it. Our whole family uses Huawei. It supports domestic products. I like it. The logistics is super fast. Will I come again if I need it? The customer service is great! !
"Don’t buy package 8 from Xingge Express. It’s not a matching casing. It’s just a scam for customers. After explaining to the customer service for a long time, I blamed others for buying the package because the machine doesn’t have good heat dissipation."
Let me help you. It’s so awesome. It’s garbage Mengniu! ! ! !
Very good battery is very durable
"hehe. The product arrived so quickly, it’s not bad, ^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^"
"Very beautiful, nice tablet, okay!"
"Afraid of health, I now drink New Mengniu. The white canned milk that leads the country in sales has been repackaged. It still has the original formula and the familiar taste~"
"One word is bad, 2 words are very bad, 3 words are very bad, and 4 words are extremely bad."
The machine is jammed and cannot be used at all. Hundreds of dollars have been wasted!
"This morning I went downstairs to buy a bag of milk. The boss asked me what brand I wanted. I said Mengniu. The boss asked again if I loved this brand. In fact, I didn’t want to be chosen. @?Taotao227"
"Support domestic products. Good value for money. Of course, the response is not as smooth as iPad."
"The stuff is very good, very satisfying, good quality and cheap."
"It's quite satisfactory, but the resolution is a bit poor. The unclearness of the photos may be related to the resolution. The video viewing effect is not bad."
It's not easy to use. I've been using it for a while and it gets stuck all the time.
"Just received it, looks good, should be fine"
I have stopped buying any Mengniu products since I was young! I would also like to advise people around me not to buy any Mengniu products! This is a morally bankrupt company! @Mengniu
"The customer service is rubbish, I made more than ten calls and couldn’t get a solution! Jingdong is doing this, and it is not far from closing down."
Mengniu pure milk. . The packaging~~~~ is so beautiful. . . I don’t know if the taste has changed. ....I just got one that I thought was aloe flavored. .
"The tablet is easy to use, it’s fast enough, and there’s no lag when playing games! The camera is also very clear and I like it very much. I have been looking at this tablet for a long time. I support JD.com and I always buy things on JD.com. Unfortunately, there are many things that JD.com does not have!"
"If you buy a mobile phone or earplugs at your home, you will get bad reviews."
"Already delivered to my home, not installed yet!"
Mengniu’s banana milk is delicious~ but it’s really expensive! The breakfast is very expensive. I missed the delicious ones bought by Zhao Xiansen. I forgot to bring them with me this morning~
Fast and well packaged
"Bad review. After using it for only a few days, the wireless network stopped working. I took it to the official after-sales service for a replacement. . . ."
Having water in your brain = drinking too much Mengniu = watching too much Xinwen Lianbo = brain damage.
"When watching the video, the picture is abnormal and the subtitles cannot be seen."
Super dissatisfied
"After using JD.com for many years, this is my first purchase*. . . . . . . The pink turned to black. The screen of the machine is covered with fingerprints. . . . . . . ."
Mengniu Niu
"If 4G is not turned on, there is often no signal, and messages cannot be sent and calls cannot be made. Turn on the 4G switch and the signal is full"
"Very good, much better than the Xiaomi one I bought. The sound quality, especially, is great. The software aspect is also good. Domestic pride"
"High cost performance, fast delivery, and a good two-day trial!"
very good product
"The price/performance ratio is very good. I bought four of them for a friend, which is pretty good."
"After using it for two days, there is often no signal, and others can’t make calls."
So don’t buy Mengniu
Never drink Mengniu Yili
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it and received it. Kakaka! The machine is not smooth at all! I haven’t installed the software yet, so why can’t I play the game after installing it? When the electricity touches people, I can't complain. One star for the courier guy."
"It’s a broken phone. I just bought it and it’s stuck all over the place. When I asked to change it to another one, the customer service always had many reasons."
"The screen is about as big as I imagined, and it’s very enjoyable to play games and watch movies."
It's very good to use. It also has a film. It's a good product and easy to use.
"Reply It turns out that you revealed that your father is Li Gang, but you should be sentenced to 3 years in prison. Can you still recognize Brother Chun in prison? Can you still comment on Weibo? Reply You are a blind person who has become demented after eating Mengniu, hehe. . ."
We are all children who were trampled by Mengniu and grew up hard. .
"Good, good, I like it very much"
"My favorite yogurt, Cass Youyi C Changyou Mengniu Inner Mongolia ancient yogurt Yantang pure white yogurt..."
"Rubbish. Within a few days, the sound would sometimes be high and sometimes low."
"Very light, fast to boot up, very convenient for watching videos, beautiful"
I bought it for office use and it's pretty good. I used it for a few days to evaluate it. It's very good. I haven't found any problems so far. The highlight is that the sound quality is good. I like it. And the battery life is okay.
"I was not given a LeTV membership card, so I contacted JD customer service to ask for a supplier, but the supplier did not respond to negative service reviews. The tablet itself is good, it’s easy to use and I haven’t played any games!"
"Gave it to a friend, it’s good, I like it very much, I will buy it next time."
Jingdong's express delivery is really fast and is not on the same level as other express delivery. It can arrive the next day.
There is no film on the screen. My colleague said it was probably second-hand. Are you disappointed?
Bad review: It can’t be charged within a month! ! ! !
The price was reduced by RMB 200 less than 12 hours after purchase. I applied for price protection with a bunch of excuses but it didn’t work. It was the first time I bought something from JD.com and I wanted to return it. It was the worst purchasing experience. I don’t want to give it even one star.
"The battery of the new phone was also not very durable. I wanted to exchange it after two days of use, but JD.com told me to take it back for testing and wouldn’t give me a spare phone. My mother went back and had no choice but to give up. Alas, JD.com is getting more and more disappointed."
Tencent web video cannot be opened. There is a problem with the system. Watching ultra-high-definition videos is lagging. The Internet speed is extremely slow.
"I heard that you like to drink Mengniu very much. So I forward it to you, and you discovered it all."
"I bought it as a gift to my mother-in-law, but it's not very good because the back shell looks a bit like plastic packaging. I’m not very satisfied with the machine. I haven’t tried it yet. Anyway, it’s much worse than Apple’s tablet. After all, what’s the price?"
"Huawei's tablets are still well made, with reasonable hardware and software configurations, and they are relatively smooth to use."
"Not good, the display is not clear, I want to apply a film"
"China's dairy industry could be wiped out. ""Mengniu's response to non-apology for expired milk was questioned"" (from http:t.cn/zWnxfcG"
"The resolution is average, the reaction speed is slow, and the voice is a bit hoarse."
"I forgot to comment while I was busy. The quality of the product is good. I have used it for a few days and the effect is very good. It heats up quickly. It should be genuine, economical and affordable, and worth it! !"
"The battery is very durable, but there is a lag when opening some video software, but overall it’s okay."
Awesome Mengniu awesome
"It looks ok, but I don’t know what happened after using it."
"The goods are good, but the logistics is very slow. Ordered at 618 and arrived at 624. They said it would be delivered the next day."
"It's good in all aspects. Once you get it, you won't like it. If it's a good product, it's a good product. It doesn't just support domestic products."
"Cheap, keep drinking... reject Mengniu like you reject drugs! +1 I don’t know why I still want to buy it. I told my dad not to buy it, but he said it didn’t matter~ and continued to drink... Why does no one care about Mengniu?"
"The pixel resolution is not good, it hurts your eyes, it’s garbage"
"Very good, upgrade immediately after booting. The speed is good. The size is just right! I just use it to watch videos"
Mengniu walnut milk. You must be extremely intelligent. .
"So-so, not great, so-so"
"Just got the goods! The appearance is very good, which means that JD Logistics can do it, but there are no earphones inside. You will only know the quality after using it."
"After payment, it took more than a week to receive the goods. This is the so-called JD.com self-operated. I feel that I no longer love it, and I will not choose JD.com first when buying things in the future. I just got the tablet, and I don’t know how it performs. I hope it can be better."
What a big phone. I finally got it. I love it! Always trust JD.com!
It runs smoothly. The Internet is fast. Huawei is good. Like it.
"This tastes good. Why do you always find it delicious? Wow, I have followed you and like many drinks, including Pulse, Red Bull, Mengniu Youyi C, Wangzai milk, and the original Jinwei@?? which we all like. Miao Yimo"
"It's really good, the screen is clear and easy to watch TV."
"The tablet that the old man received at home has not been opened yet, and I don’t know how the packaging is. Anyway, the logistics is very fast. When the time comes, they will open it and see how the quality of the machine is, and then make further comments."
"Boycott unscrupulous companies! Let more people reject McDonald's and KFC, just like rejecting Mengniu and Yili!"
"There are no gifts, and the packaging has pictures. I don’t know if there is anything missing."
Very satisfied very satisfied very satisfied very satisfied very satisfied very satisfied very satisfied
"You can connect to wifi, the signal is good"
"When I bought it, there were a lot of scratches, like those caused by falling on the floor. When I contacted customer service, no one responded. I can only use it like this and consider myself unlucky. I’m so disappointed."
Jingdong big sale. As a platinum customer for many years. It must be supported. They are all commonly used. In stock.
"The worst customer service I have ever encountered, no reply for half an hour. Fuck you dick"
The computer freezes and freezes. The battery is not durable and runs out of power in 10 hours.
"This is my second time to buy it, but I haven’t installed it yet. I’ll comment after it’s installed and easy to use."
"Very nice, nice phablet."
"It was okay when I received it on the first day, but I couldn't charge it the next day. Please don't buy JD.com products, it's all a lie."
"There are actually black dots in the middle of the screen, making it difficult to support domestic products."
I bought it as a Father's Day gift for my dad. I used it for a few days before I can comment. It's very easy to use. I was originally worried about various problems. But it's still good to use. It's simple and easy to operate. The pixels are okay. The price is worth the money~
The cell phone signal is so poor that it keeps disconnecting and I don’t have any headphones.
"There is nothing in the phone. I really regret buying it. Dear friends, please don’t buy it. It’s not worth the price. I originally received a free gift when I placed the order, but I was left speechless after receiving nothing."
Not all milk is called Deluxe
Mother-in-law likes it very much^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_ ^^_^^_^^_^^_^^_^
"One point is for express delivery, but the next day after I receive it, it is always jammed."
You can't insert a phone card into this one. It's pretty good.
Do you boycott Japanese products just because they are Japanese brands? Why don’t you boycott Mengniu? What is the measure of an angry young man’s brain?
"Bad review, wrong product"
"Bad, bad, bad. Customer service is indifferent. What should I do? If there is a problem, leave a bad review."
It’s so depressing to see the price drop after buying it! It’s not clear when watching TV
The purchase was too expensive and I applied for a refund but no response.
"After opening the box and reading the manual, I found that there is a card slot shared by the SIM card and the external memory card, and I can only choose to use one. I'm confused, this design is puzzling. This can also be called dual cards and external memory cards."
"Oops, I was moved as soon as I got up. This is the first time I've ever been touched. My mother has never called her that, and most of her previous messages were about housework. It seemed that my mother really had a fever. I was moved and drank Mengniu."
Pour it down quickly. Same question. I’m very confused as to why Mengniu hasn’t closed down yet.
"The price was reduced two days after purchase, the return button is not sensitive, negative review"
HUAWEI Honor X2 Call Tablet 7 inches (octa-core 2G/16G mobile 4G) Moonlight Silver
"I have been paying attention to it. When I received it, the quality is good, the color is good, the brightness is good, and the picture is delicate and smooth."
"Why are there no headphones? I have a good mobile phone, can you give me some earphones, please?"
"Listening to HRM again, the teacher praised the philosophy of ""letting nature take its course and returning to basics"", liked Huawei, CITIC Mengniu, and mentioned Kazuo Inamori many times. . . I don’t know why I don’t have much resonance with him, and I miss him very much."
"After signing for it, the charger was broken and could not be charged. I contacted customer service and asked me questions for a long time. Finally, I was asked to contact JD customer service. I really felt that the service and quality were poor."
The machine is really good! They didn’t even give me a leather case or headphones! A little confused! But my heart to support domestic products remains unchanged!
Signal difference! ! !
"Bought this for my nephew, hope it will be useful."
I have stopped drinking Mengniu for a long time. Fraud must be logical and systematic!
It's a good product. It's what I want. It should be the first choice for those who like to watch movies on mobile phones. The screen is large and the resolution is high. It's much lighter than those with an 8-inch size or above. It's not tiring to hold it.
"I bought the package version during the Jingdong Mall event, and I can use coupons. It is much cheaper than Huawei’s official website. It looks like it should be a genuine tablet. The specific situation still needs time to be tested."
Very good and very satisfied!
Mengniu is one of the companies with the worst PR team in history!
"The black frame is too big, too big, and the workmanship and other things are all blackened by the black frame."
"Big screen, good quality, good to use"
"The machine is fine for the time being. It doesn't feel like a new machine. JD.com's logistics is very good. Thousands of items are packed directly in cartons. Damn it, there are no protective measures at all? ? ? You are so awesome, why don't you go to heaven?"
The resolution is too poor and the packaging is not in place. The delivery speed is very good.
"Today I drank a pack of milk produced by Mengniu on November 14th that I bought at Carrefour in Zhongguancun on November 16th and it smelled like feet! CNM! You want to disgust me to death! If you can’t afford to buy Mengniu from now on, then don’t buy Mengniu!"
"It doesn't come with earplugs. Is it because of the price? However, we still support domestic brands."
"Not bad, very good. . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
This is the third time I bought a mobile phone from JD.com. It is still so good. I support JD.com. It feels good to use and there is no lag. I consulted a lot before buying. The customer service is very good. I will comment after using it for a few days. It is good.
"Unique to China, it has long been proven impossible abroad. Let Mengniu continue to harm Chinese consumers. . ."
"The stuff is really not that good, it’s a bit laggy to use, so I can barely use it."
not bad! The price dropped just after receiving it.
Very good. I have been using this brand at home. Very good. I have been using this brand at home.
"Dongdong is very good, very powerful, express delivery is a thumbs up"
"I placed the order this morning and my baby started playing with it this evening. It was so fast. The tablet is very good, high definition, fast running speed, low price and very affordable. I like it very much!"
It's very good. I've been using it for half a month.
Display is poor
"Because of JD Logistics, I didn’t place the order directly from other companies. I placed the order last night and received it this morning. Like! The packaging is very good. I bought it for children. I hope it lasts!"
It matches the description. The logistics speed is very fast. I bought it for an event. It’s quite cost-effective.
"I won’t even drink Mengniu and Yili even if I kill them, they are all pig food..."
"Overall, 899 can only be like this. It has low resolution and lag. Can you refund it to me? I will pay more to buy an Apple iPad mini 2."
"Just use it, slow to respond"
"It took 3 days to receive the goods. They were not even delivered to my door. They were placed in a small store in the community and I was asked to pay a dollar. What happened? This service is too bad, right?"
"The speed is very slow, please buy with caution!"
My confidence in Mengniu moves China. .
"Reply You are so talented. I still dare to drink Mengniu, but unfortunately the cow no longer eats grass. The grass is specially used to borrow arrows. Reply Huh? I drink Mengniu every day (cheap)."
I also sell mobile phones. I cried when I received the machine. The packaging is even worse than that of older phones. I won’t return it. I don’t know who to complain to. Please don’t be like me!
"I just started using it, it’s pretty good, the response is very fast, I’ll review it after using it for a while"
"I have always used Huawei products, which support domestic production and have good quality and performance."
"The screen flickering occurred within a month. not available. . . It cannot be returned or exchanged, only repaired. . Communicate with customer service. Except I'm sorry and I'm just going to fix it. It’s less than a month old, so I suggest you think carefully before buying."
"I bought it for my parents, I haven’t seen the machine yet."
"It can meet daily needs. It is good for reading PDF files, and it feels almost like reading a book."
"It's terrible, the screen is blurry, and there is still no response after half a month of repairs. I can only see a status of processing."
"There are no headphones as promised, and no rebate as promised. I just received them today. Don't just trust their customer service, they can't do what they say. Don't know how the quality is yet."
Jingdong is fast and good quality
JD.com restricted my account from receiving coupons
It's very good to use. I bought it for my child.
"I can’t install the sd card, I’m so depressed, what should I do? ,,,"
The tempered film sent was actually broken.
It’s been a long time since I bought it and I forgot to leave a review. I’ve been using it and it’s very useful. Good review.
Very lofty
"I have never drank Mengniu Yili. You are so dedicated! ! ! Damn, you are so dedicated! . . . Mengniu, you are so fake. . Repost Weibo"
"Very good, very comfortable to use. No problems have been found so far. Very convenient."
"Not good at all, very stuck"
Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu...even dinner? !
The delivery speed is amazing. I have shopped on JD.com many times and I trust JD.com very much.
"Overall it looks good, but the resolution is too poor and unclear, and my eyes can't stand it after looking at it for a while. I originally bought it for my children to play games with, but now it seems I can no longer let them play with it."
"It's so easy to use, this is the third one I've purchased."
What the hell is this? It doesn’t even have a built-in video player. I bought the m3 just to watch movies. It’s so fucking disgusting.
It's pretty good. I'm quite satisfied with the appearance. The screen is just right. I like it very much. Always wanted to buy one
Mainly because I drank Bao Mengniu tonight and I felt very unhappy. The current status of the twelve zodiac signs
It’s a great birthday gift for my mom
Is the customer service helpful? I can only say it's terrible.
The price/performance ratio is pretty good. I bought it for my baby and it runs smoothly.
618 was received on the same day. It was produced in January 2017. Are there so few people buying it? There is no Honor of Kings in Huawei App Store!
"Just a few days after buying it, the price was reduced by * yuan. This is bullying honest people. It’s a bad review. I hate buying things like this the most."
"My wife likes it, it’s good, but I only saw the M3 after I placed the order, which was only 200 short of it, and I felt a little regretful."
"When I first bought it, in order to wait for the 128, it was out of stock at first, and there was no classification later. In the end, I bought the 32, which was good. Now the 128 is out again. You have to know that I bought another 599 headphone. . . What a trap"
"Very good, for the old man, he likes you quite a lot."
"The workmanship of this tablet is very good, and the main sound effect is very good. However, the camera resolution is not good, and there is smear when reading text. I don’t know why Huawei made it like this."
"It looks okay, but it’s not very convenient to use. Furthermore, the packaging is so poor that it was damaged when it was delivered to me."
"nice~given as a gift, very satisfied |"
It’s so bad that I don’t even bother to say it.
"Not bad, not bad. The tablet is very powerful and the price is cheap. It is enough for watching movies and playing games."
I am very dissatisfied. The resolution is too low. It hurts my eyes and causes dizziness. The screen cannot slide when playing games and is stuck. Isn’t this a lie?
"Very cost-effective, with an unlimited keyboard and mouse set and OTG cable, it’s better to use than a laptop"
"Too bad, don’t even buy it! I've only been using it for two months and it's stuck, not to mention the screen flickering, the response is too slow, and it even shuts down automatically!"
"The mobile phone has been returned, and there have been complaints of fraud when I returned to the mobile phone store thousands of times."
"Fast delivery, good service! You only know after using something for a while!"
The speaker broke after less than a month of use.
"Do you still dare to buy things online? The fan is broken, and the installer will charge an additional 30 yuan for the installation fee."
generally! generally!
"The baby is okay, but the service attitude is very poor. After receiving the goods, I found that there was no invoice. I contacted customer service and ignored them. If there is a problem with my goods, who should I contact? I am so disappointed."
The screen resolution is not very high
Very bad at taking pictures. . . . . . . . . . .
"The service attitude was good and the promised items were delivered. I would especially like to praise the courier of SF Express. Because something happened at home, I had to make two trips in vain, but they were not angry and still delivered the goods to my home. Thank you very much."
The machine gets hot easily! Then there are twists and turns! ! ! Say important things three times! ! I can’t bear the obsessive-compulsive disorder! ! Can be returned
Mengniu’s new products are pretty good
The unscrupulous Mengniu will be punished.
"The resolution is not enough, the price was reduced the day after I bought it, which is frustrating!"
"Poor workmanship, does not match the physical body, presses back camera, and earpiece"
"One word, pit"
"Fast logistics, good delivery service, JD.com's self-operated products, trustworthy, guaranteed quality, worry-free returns and exchanges, I like it. Really like it!"
"Garbage, poor sound quality, low resolution, low low........."
"Bought for my family, the size is just right, very good, I trust JD.com"
The tablet is easy to use and looks cool!
It's a good thing. It's a pity that the screen is not as great as expected. I still give it a thumbs up.
Logistics speed is ok
I just received it and it’s broken. It’s so annoying.
We don't need Mengniu
"Jingdong's handling: After submitting the return application, Jingdong quickly sent someone to pick it up. After testing, it was found that the battery had serious problems. Full refund."
"It's okay, I just bought a toy for the old man to relieve his boredom, watch videos and read the news. It doesn't have to be complicated."
"I don’t want to use software such as push services and Huawei Cloud Services at all, but they will always be on my mobile phone."
"Bad review! There was no invoice, and the phone case was not delivered. I contacted customer service to ask what was going on, but no one answered me after two days of contacting me. I was really convinced."
"Let me say it again, Mengniu’s problem is not in the factory. Mengniu’s factory 5S management is the best in China, no exaggeration! Mengniu’s problem lies in its milk source. I hope everyone will visit the ranch."
"It's so rubbish. It dropped again in less than two days. This must be a bad review. JD.com only delivered one-half of the item, and I had to go to JD.com to find the other part."
"It's actually Mengniu... Should I not drink it, or should I not drink it?"
Mengniu manager was arrested for allegedly tampering with production dates http:t.cn/zlvaup9 (Shared from @headline news)
"After using it for some time, I feel it’s okay. It’s more convenient to use than an iPad. It doesn’t have so many restrictions. It’s also cheap. I can buy two of them. I’m satisfied."
"Called Mengzi~ The name starts with M... It would be best to call it ""Mengniu""... Repost on Weibo"
"It’s a tablet, not a large mobile phone. It doesn’t even have a USB port. It has very few programs and is useless! In this case, what's the use of him? Rubbish."
"The delivery speed is very fast, the operation is smooth and the screen is clear."
"There are Mengniu's new milk and Junlebao's new milk in the refrigerator. For as long as I can remember, apart from Mengniu, the only one I like is Mengniu. I have always been a fan of Mengniu. Now that the weather is getting cold, why don't you try Mengniu? young man"
"The logistics is fast, the store is good, the goods are high quality and low price"
Is it still feasible but there is no membrane to be wild? The car cannot be downloaded either
I’m really disappointed. The price has dropped so much just two days after I bought it. I can’t apply for price protection yet. It’s a bummer. The tablet is also a bit small.
There is an odor. The system takes up too much space. The machine does not replay the game smoothly. Mainly watching movies in high definition is not clear. I have high hopes for glory this time. I don’t know if I can return it after unpacking it.
The speed is fast. I placed the order in the morning and it arrived in the evening. The courier is very responsible. The product has good sound quality and is easy to carry. I am very satisfied.
"The products are very good, come on JD.com! support! !"
Mixed-race Mengniu: I like this change very much
"Let me just say, those milk-drinking things can kill people! ! Last time I said Mengniu was fucking rubbish. I was very angry, but I couldn't do anything. I'm sorry, but I can't change anything. I'm not patriotic."
"Good quality and low price, very good. Just used it. I’ll take a look."
"Huawei is a brand I trust. I already have two Huawei mobile phones. This time I bought a Huawei tablet, which made my family happy. I tried it, it’s fast, the picture is clear, and it’s much more convenient to read WeChat. Like it very much!"
"It's not good at all. I bought it for my mother. The sound of incoming calls is a little quiet, so my mother can't hear it at all. What a cell phone."
It's okay. I bought it for my dad. He likes it very much. I hope it can be used for a longer time. I feel that it is troublesome to deal with JD.com's warranty at home.
"When I bought it, I saw that there was a protective cover in the after-sales package, but when I sent it, it didn’t come with it, which was very frustrating. The phone is good, but a bit unpleasant!"
"Only deserves a one star rating. Just two days after buying it, it keeps crashing. Speechless."
"The response speed is very fast, the sound effects and picture quality are both good. It is much easier for the baby to do his English homework. Believe in Huawei’s quality and support domestic products"
"Okay, it’s very impressive, but the screen resolution is a bit low, otherwise it’s great!"
"It took more than 20 hours to process a refund order and it still couldn’t be resolved. It was pushed back and forth. As a result, I couldn’t apply for price protection, which cost me dozens of dollars more."
JD Express is fast. The tablet is very good. I have been using it for a few days without any problems. I hope there will be no problems in the future.
so-so
It’s only been 20 days and my voice has become smaller. It’s very bad. Don’t be fooled.
"Playing Bright Continent with low special effects is a bit laggy, but it can be played. I haven’t tried it yet."
"It was very bad. After using it for less than seven or eight days, the speaker of the mobile phone was broken. I could not listen to music or make calls. The customer service attitude was very bad. Bad review, bad review. Very cheating"
Very good. It feels good and smooth when using Huawei for the first time. I hope it won’t get stuck after using it for a long time. The express arrived on time. Thank you to JD.com for your hard work during this period!
"It's fast, it's ok, it's worth recommending"
"I can’t even use the data card, I’m tired."
slow. . . Really slow. . .
good. Service attitude is very good
I can no longer complain about Mengniu! !
Since using smartphones. I have always used Huawei products. But this tablet is really rubbish. The signal is poor and the address book often freezes. You have to restart to find contacts and the performance is poor.
Completely ban Mengniu
I only reviewed it after using it. It’s good enough for two people. The installer was also very considerate.
Don’t drink Mengniu
Very good stuff!
The basic functions are okay and much cheaper than Apple
"This is too cruel to fruit fans. Reply: Support Maotai to become the national liquor, support Mengniu milk to become the national milk, support Sanlu milk powder to become the national powder"
"Thank you for your support, we will continue to work hard! Support it! When I have a baby, I will also drink Oshi Mengniu, organic is the best."
"A very good phone tablet, suitable in size, fast in response, and supports domestic products!"
"The resolution is very poor, and I only bought a tablet and charger without a protective film."
"Regarding the news that Mengniu tampered with the production date and made huge profits, Mengniu's official press conference admitted that it was true, but did not mention the issue of apology or compensation. Mengniu is a cow. Can we not drink? Can we let him close the door?"
"Hey, it’s not easy to use, it’s really not easy to use"
"The design of the phone is crap, the volume button is in the middle and I often press it by mistake. The traffic signal is very poor. Often disconnected. My previous Samsung didn't do this. Same environment. Don't talk about the problem with my router. Don't buy it, everyone."
"It's okay, the picture is still a bit lacking in my opinion."
"This phone is not great, the resolution is low, the first system had a problem and could not be unlocked, the screen of the new one turned yellow, and the screen obviously leaked light. The 1 star is for the service of JD.com, the service is really good, returns and exchanges are very fast. Someone will follow up"
It’s not good at all. I don’t even have any headphones. Others gave me a lot of stuff.
"This is the third tablet I have bought. Together with X1 and other phones, I have bought six Huawei phones in total. Huawei is good. I will only buy Huawei phones when I change phones in the future."
"It runs fast, has a high screen resolution, and has exquisite workmanship. It’s worth buying!"
I don’t think I will ever buy anything from JD.com again.
This is the worst-tasting milk I have ever tasted except Terensu. Mengniu is really awesome!
"Haha, it feels good to use, not much worse than Apple. If domestic products can maintain this quality, there will be no need to buy foreign products in the future."
"I got the new product, it’s okay to feel the speed and so on. Hope you don't disappoint me. Looking forward to shipping."
"The product is too bad, the price is okay, so be it! Huawei products are average."
"When I received the item, I felt it was very ordinary."
"Compared with Imagination 5, the screen is obviously smaller and shrunk."
There is a 360-degree difference in attitudes before placing an order and after purchasing. The most basic accessories for buying a mobile phone are not available.
"Huawei's system is a bit unfamiliar to me. Can I say it sucks? I can only say that it’s okay among domestic products, but it’s not good if you complain too much."
"Support domestic production, good performance, beautiful screen. Just a little bit smaller."
"Slow response, easy to jam, customer service is not very attentive, needs to improve quality"
The baby that just arrived feels good. Conscience HUAWEI
My eyes hurt after watching it for about an hour! ! !
"The phone is fast, the screen is big enough, and it is very comfortable to use."
"The logistics actually sent it to the wrong delivery station, so I had to wait an extra day. However, I feel that this product is a great value and no problems have been found so far."
The price was reduced too quickly. I asked customer service for the price reduction at night. The customer service was very poor. The next day it was the original price and the customer service said there was no price reduction. It was less than 7 days.
"Great, it’s economical and easy to use. Will continue to support"
Mengniu! You are awesome!
"JD.com’s customer service is terrible, and its logistics is even worse."
"I'm a bit disappointed, giving a bad review"
There is no film attached. It would be a waste for those who don’t know how to apply the film to use the film.
Only the 128g version has earphones. The 64g version is the least cost-effective version. I bought the wrong one and it has a charging socket.
Jingdong is different. They will also test whether the headphone jack works for you first. Service attitude is okay
"I can't say enough, it's not worth the price. Please consider it carefully before buying it. I regretted it the night I bought it. The delivery person's service attitude is very good. I give the delivery person 10,000 likes for their service."
"The screen border of the machine is too big. When the actual screen is on, it is ugly. It’s terrible. My parents use it. I can’t return it when I see it. I’m depressed. Don’t buy this."
What kind of tablet is it? It’s not flat. The sides are tilted up.
"I opened it when I got it home. After watching TV for a while, I chatted with my colleagues on WeChat. The WeChat video and photos were unclear and blurry. I was extremely disappointed."
"I bought it and found a slight crack in the screen, but I thought it didn't matter because I was busy and ignored it. The crack became bigger the next day. I contacted customer service, and the customer service said to contact after-sales service. After-sales service said that if it exceeds 24 hours, you can only pay for it yourself. The wallet is empty"
"Okay, ok, ok!"
Why don't you have an invoice and earplugs?
"The thing is okay. However, safety and damage prevention measures were not taken when shipping and packaging. When I received it, the packaging box was a little deformed and I was worried about the contents inside. Fortunately, it was okay."
"This is a sincere review. It is not easy to use at all. It is fully charged and does not run in the background. It is just in standby mode. ""None of them are playing with the phone."" The standby time of the phone is almost 20 hours and it automatically shuts down. I am depressed."
"Not high resolution, same photo. Can't see clearly at all."
"Place an order on the same day and receive the goods on the same day. As always, we support JD.com’s self-operation. JD.com’s logistics is awesome! I bought the pad for my mother to use in Landlords. She likes it very much?"
"The resolution is low, and it’s really stupid that they don’t even send a film."
Mengniu’s immortality is unforgivable.
"Advantages: 1. Beautiful appearance, 2. Excellent sound quality, 3. High-definition screen; Disadvantages: 1. The edge of the screen is not 2.5D, so it scratches your hand when holding it. 2. The camera does not have a flash, which is a minor flaw."
"Good, cost-effective, suitable size, but still feels a bit thick"
The quality of the product is good. I used it several times before I reviewed it. The seller's attitude is very good. The express delivery is fast. Thank you boss.
"Fuck Mengniu, it’s disgusting"
"I’m not satisfied with the packaging, I don’t know what’s going on with the phone, I just started using it, and the customer service attitude is bad, so I’m leaving a negative review."
Junk memory card slot is broken
The logistics was very fast. But it was just a bare device. It didn’t come with anything. It didn’t even have the most basic things like headphones or cases. I wasn’t satisfied...
Support Mengniu. Support domestic dairy companies that work hard.
"There is no 16G of memory, and the running memory is not enough. It only has 1.5G, which is a bit fake."
Sister Zhiling is so beautiful! How can it be so clear and smart? Haha. . The second half of the MV is very suitable for Mengniu Sour Yoghurt to continue to be used as an advertisement hahahaha! ! Still strawberry flavored. .
"JD Logistics is fast. The order placed yesterday afternoon was already being dispatched at around 9am the next morning! As a young man from a small county, I am deeply impressed by the speed of JD Logistics! Awesome!"
Mengniu smiled but said nothing
"Haha? Not bad. Although it feels a bit slow to start or update the system, the price/performance ratio is really good."
The screen is big enough for reading books and watching videos.
I bought it for my children to play with. The screen is very good and the sound quality is indeed better than ordinary tablets.
"The volume buttons are raised, same problem as X1"
"It's a good tablet, with good color and speed. It's just not as convenient as Huawei's phone to go back and switch to the desktop. Maybe I haven't found the trick. In short, I'm satisfied."
"The screen is big, trust Huawei."
"I showed this video to my mom, I like it"
"Huawei's quality is trustworthy, the battery is durable, the screen is clear, the system is smooth, and it's great value for money."
It’s really good. This tablet is very easy to use.
"It's really good, my colleagues said it's very good!"
"You can still take a look at the screen when the screen is turned on, but when the screen is turned on, it looks ugly, with a huge black border and virtual buttons that take up a large area of ??the screen. Does the product manager have shit in his head?"
"I bought it, but it couldn't be turned on. When I connected it to the charger, it showed that the battery level was 0. After charging for a long time, it was still 0%... This probability shouldn't be very high, right?"
"It was *bucks cheaper in just a few days. Jingdong made me, an old user, sad. There was no price guarantee. I really didn’t even want to give it. It was *reduced* to*, and I was cheated out of *bucks."
"I bought it for a friend, who really likes it. I didn’t expect that something worth a few hundred yuan can play games so well, and there’s no lag at all."
"The packaging of the self-operated store is really not flattering. The outer packaging is not fully covered with film packaging, but is wrapped with transparent tape on both sides! Haven’t read anything else yet!"
I bought it for a friend and I feel very good after receiving it. I don’t know what effect it will have after using it.
It’s still so easy to use. The previous one was broken by a child and I immediately bought the same one. It’s awesome.
It took 48 hours for the mobile phone to be delivered to Tianjin Huayuan to arrange delivery. I am not satisfied!
The tablet is not very responsive and it freezes after just a few days of use. I won’t buy it online next time. It’s very deceptive. It degraded within three days of purchase. There is no guarantee at all.
"The logistics is very fast, and the courier has a good service attitude. Memory is too small"
"Guangming Beiyou's fresh milk is the best, Mengniu's pure milk is second, and Yili's is too inferior. bright"
Huawei is indeed great. This is my first time buying a Huawei brand. I feel very satisfied!
Good review. I gave it to my dad for Father’s Day. I hope he’s happy.
"When I open QQ without headphones, the echo sound is noisy and the sound is noisy."
"I feel deceived, thinking that the running memory is 4g, but it turns out that it is still 2g, and the internal memory is also very small. , very rubbish, strongly not recommended to buy. Jingdong is a trap."
Not bad! I just bought it to watch a movie.
"The phone is very poor, the call is often disconnected, the battery life is very short, and sometimes the call cannot be made."
"The packaging is very nice! I also got a screen film as a gift, but unfortunately the film got damaged. The resolution is super clear and the app is very smooth. Thanks to the courier guy for your hard work, he is still delivering lunch."
"A Mengniu manager was caught tampering with the production date, involving 3,000 boxes of pure milk"
The stuff is good and the packaging is also very good. Those are good gifts as gifts.
"Not bad, the price is also cheap. The last mobile phone was X1"
Commit suicide by drinking Mengniu?
"There is something wrong with the tablet. It cannot be charged. When I unplug the charger, it runs out of power. I need to return it."
"It’s still pretty good, give it a thumbs up to Huawei"
"Very cool, worth having."
"I have been using it for more than a month, almost two months, and it still feels very good. It is still ok to switch from Huawei mobile phones to tablets."
"Not bad, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"After the mobile phone was sent, there was no machine to seal it, seal it, or return it. JD.com is becoming more and more unreliable."
"I only received the tablet, but I don’t know where the 64G card is."
"The phone is good and the express delivery is also very good, but I have a negative review because I bought it yesterday and the price was reduced today."
The quality of Huawei is still trustworthy. The sound quality of this tablet is very good. What I am most satisfied with is the sound.
"As a result, I spent money on JD.com to buy a broken tablet, and I couldn’t return it, so I felt like I was being forced to receive the product."
A gift for my dad. It works well. The mobile phone is also from Huawei. It comes with the package and is easy to learn to operate.
The screen is unclear and the resolution is too low
Mengniu’s new packaging is very nice. . It makes it look fresh and fresh. . . Then I won’t buy it either. . . . . . .
"Received the goods, the screen is a bit small"
"The sound is bad, the screen is unclear, and the sensitivity is not enough"
"Mengniu has a problem, Yili has a problem, Yantang has a problem, Nutrition Express has a problem, milk powder has a problem, can Gan still be drunk?"
"I received the baby this morning. I couldn't wait to take it apart and look at the pictures. The screen is big enough and has a good texture. I've been using it for a while. Overall, it's pretty good. The casing is also good. It looks quite classy. I'll come back next time. ."
It’s not good. The battery is too bad. It only lasts less than a month on full charge.
"Not bad, I like it very much"
"It's okay after using it for a day, but the battery drains out very quickly."
The request for exchange was rejected on the grounds that the three-warranty period had expired. Invoice issued on November 14th. After-sales service applied on December 15th. It is said that the exchange time stipulated by the national three guarantees is 15 days.
"The thing is good, it feels like a bigger mobile phone."
"I didn’t even get a pair of headphones when I bought two, and I fell out of love instantly."
It’s very easy to use and economical. It’s no problem to use this if you want to play games or watch movies. The key is that it’s cheap.
"The consumer experience is extremely high, the delivery is fast, and the attitude is super good. The only drawback is that the resolution of the product is really low. . . I hope the technology will improve in this area"
"The price was reduced by *RMB on the first day after purchase. I found it. The price was reduced by RMB100 on the second day. I also gave membership as a gift. If you don’t give it to me, I won’t dismantle it. It’s only the second day. I’ll go there."
"No door-to-door delivery of garbage, garbage, garbage"
"It's okay. It doesn't get very hot, but it definitely gets hot when playing games. The temperature is acceptable."
The machine is pretty good and the sound quality is pretty good. . .
Very perfect and satisfied! ! ! ! !
A birthday gift for my husband. He picked it out himself. It’s very good. It’s great for watching movies.
"Bad review, bad review, bad review, not worth the price"
"I just want to say that the screen is not straight. I don’t believe in the top 500 anymore. It’s really a scam. I have replaced two of them and they are still the same. Comrades, look at yours and see if they are straight."
"I just want to say that after buying it for two days, it crashed 5 times, the screen had severe smearing, and the frame was slightly dented. No exchange, no warranty, no return. Huawei, you can do that."
"Good as always. This is my third purchase for someone. Very useful, affordable and durable."
"Sound quality feels good, but the size is a bit small"
"It's okay, okay, the sound quality is pretty good, okay, good, okay, it's a large phone."
Mengniu is very domineering
"Good quality and low price, good online shopping. But I just don’t understand why there is an extra small hole."
I bought it just over two months ago and it broke down and I can’t make calls. The quality is too bad. I still protect it as a treasure every day. I also bought a cell phone leather case that cost *yuan.
Reject KFC like you reject Mengniu
"1. There is serious smearing when dragging while watching a web page, and ghosting of text in video barrages. 2. The charging socket is very difficult to plug in, which is an obvious design flaw."
"Huawei tablet is quite good, with good display and performance. The storage memory in the body is a bit less than 16g. Fortunately, it can also insert a memory card. Still good. Worth recommending"
"The super card is not easy to use. If I were not in a hurry, I would really want to cancel it, so I would have to make do with it. There are a lot of applications in it, and they don’t look like new ones."
Very suitable for studying. The memory is just right. I like the price and the good reviews.
"It should be good, I’m using it very well so far!"
"The charger can't be plugged in, it's rubbish!"
"Things received, very good"
"Ah, easy to use? Not easy to use, bad service, not satisfied! ! ! !"
Rubbish Jingdong. Good impression can be obtained at once 0
I have bought it many times. It is very good. The logistics and delivery are fast. The delivery guy has a good service attitude. I will buy it again in the future.
"I have been using Huawei since mate7, and now it has released a tablet. It works well and supports domestic products."
Bad review! This is the worst tablet I have ever bought. It is difficult to plug it in for charging. The startup software also contains usage records and other people’s photos (ugh). It’s sad. It’s too troublesome to return it. I bought it just to read comics and just use it.
"Very good, the screen is clear and the size is just right. The giveaways are also great."
"I bought one to watch movies, the screen is big enough"
"It is better than expected, the speed is very smooth, the system optimization is very good, it is very convenient to use, the installation and uninstallation of software are very fast, many of the built-in software can also be deleted, and the screen effect is very good."
"Pretty good?, the system is smoother and more natural! More humane! Like it very much"
"There's nothing wrong with it yet, just use it and see..."
There is a gift just one day after receiving it. I am speechless. Will I come again next time?
"The logistics was very fast. The order I placed yesterday arrived at around 8 o'clock this morning. It felt pretty good when I started using it. But there is one problem: the outer packaging is the lowest among all the express delivery I have received, so I will deduct one star."
The price has been reduced. No refund of price difference will be given. Not satisfied
Sometimes the screen goes black and I have to turn it on again. So annoying.
"I still stubbornly believe that before Mengniu was investigated and punished, everything like KFC was just a cloud."
"The unit bought it as a prize, so generous~"
"It's very laggy, the resolution is not good, I didn't imagine it, I don't have a screen saver or a jacket, and I don't have any headphones."
"Your Wandashan is so pure, my Mengniu is so pure~~~~"
"It's not bad, after all, it costs over a thousand dollars, and it can cause lag when playing certain games."
"Just a mobile phone and charger, not even an invoice or headphones. It was my first time to buy a mobile phone online and I felt very bad."
The phone is easy to use and the screen is extra large. If you like the big screen
"It is genuine, the quality is very good, the logistics is super fast, and the gifts are also very practical. I prefer watching dramas and listening to music, so I can't verify the speed yet. I'm very satisfied!"
"I was mentally prepared by reading Tieba before buying it, but it was a bit disappointing. The smearing was quite serious and it felt like it was of no use."
"Regarding the price guarantee issue, Huawei flagship store customer service referred me to JD customer service! Jingdong’s customer service is dead, and they don’t reply for a long time. There is no way to complain."
Can you reduce the price on JD.com when you just bought it?
Just think of supporting domestic products~ I’m not very satisfied with the tablet. The express delivery service is okay.
"The mobile phone started to freeze just two days after I bought it. It’s not that Chinese people are unwilling to buy domestic mobile phones, but that domestic mobile phones are really not good enough. I hope manufacturers will make the mobile phone system more perfect."
"I just bought it the day before and the price was reduced the next day. When I applied for a price guarantee, it said that the set would not be accepted. The gift was worth it. After all, I spent a lot more. What a loss. Tablet is just average"
"Good sound quality, very smooth, first-class picture quality, worthy of a domestic product"
"Ever since I bought Mengniu's Guanyi milk for my son, he has turned a blind eye to the Huahua Niu black currant yogurt that he loved in the past. Duoyou, dear Bao'er, you really know what the product is. You can drink whatever you like when it's expensive!"
Things are very good and the internet speed is very fast
"The gift is gone and there is no clear answer, which is very bad."
"I just got it. The operation is very smooth and the resolution is very high. After watching the video for a while, it feels very smooth."
The logistics is super fast. I just placed the order last night and received it at noon today. I turned it on and looked at it. It’s not bad. The quality is also very good. Like it! !
Lihua actually paired it with Mengniu's yogurt. I'm confused whether to drink it or not.
Things have been received. The box is in perfect condition. Very satisfied. Logistics is also fast. The courier guy's service attitude is also good. A very satisfying purchase
"Less than a week after I got the tablet, the screen was burned out. My application for after-sales service was rejected. I was disappointed."
"The workmanship is exquisite and can compete with Pingguo. The battery life is good, but the configuration is a bit low. In short, it is okay and cost-effective."
There is nothing to say about Huawei's products. They are high-end. I like them. Self-operated Huawei products are fast and offer many discounts. They are great! !
"As soon as I received the product, the price was reduced. Then I contacted customer service and the price difference was immediately refunded. I was very satisfied with the flexibility of JD.com staff. I have been shopping on JD.com for 6 years and will always be with you in the future..."
"Mengniu is not a ""cow"", it is a ""tumor"". Shameless and unscrupulous. Apologize and apologize. Keep shouting every day. Be responsible for the health of your customers, cherish life and stay away from Mengniu @Friends of Walmart"
The stuff is good.
"The price was reduced two days after buying it, which meant that I didn't get any discount at all, and I still lost money. It was very unpleasant, and I couldn't get more than one star."
The Huawei brand is really good. I started the update immediately after receiving it. It feels good! Watching videos and listening to music on the phone are awesome!
So funny! I burst out laughing when I saw Mengniu
I don’t know what to say! Watching a video on Youku often freezes and cannot be restored for half a day.
"That's it, the screen resolution is not high and nothing is sent."
"It is very good to use it. The video is clear and the screen is big enough. It is very good to watch movies, especially the Blu-ray one. I will use it for a while in the future."
"The overall performance was not too surprising. The thickness is medium and the assembly clearance is okay. My big black side, big black side. Praise for the good sound effects and good display speed."
"Not targeting Huawei products, but only targeting the platform JD.com, it is a garbage company. I wish it will go bankrupt soon!"
Why is there no invoice for my tablet that arrived yesterday?
"It’s expensive! On the day I received the goods, I discovered that the bare metal Huawei phone was priced at 1488! It feels like a lie! ! ? ?"
"Not bad, it’s much more convenient to watch discs."
Mabi's Niu Gensheng is a cheat. I accidentally bought the wrong Mengniu in this package. Should I throw it away or throw it away?
Mengniu can't afford to be hurt... February can't be hurt...
"The phone looks good, runs fast, and is cheaper than in a physical store."
"I found Mengniu Tilan Shengxue ice cream to be pretty good, so I’ve been eating it recently!"
"Absolutely bad review. Except for the courier brother, it's okay. Your customer service Xiaoxue has a problem. If there are any gifts, let me know. This is the tone of the bad review"
Cheating Mengniu
"I must leave a negative review. I got a 100 discount right after I received the goods. There was no refund for the price difference or anything, and there was no leather case included. I must leave a negative review!"
"This phone gets hot as soon as I use it! It’s too bad, but the logistics was fast. I didn’t want it in the first place, but now it gets hot as soon as I use it."
"One word! It’s too stuck! My wife is too stuck! The new tablet card customer service also asked me to clean up the backend! Cleaning up what? Forget it, it’s troublesome to return the goods on JD.com. Just use it!"
"Very good, very good, good, good, good, good."
Mengniu’s vitality is so strong that I am amazed!
"The pixels are a flaw, but other aspects are okay. The front camera is only 300,000, so taking pictures is expensive."
"They promised to give away the film and shell, but the price didn't drop even a cent and they used it as a promotion. When they received the goods, they said they had run out. They just lied to people and didn't want to give a single star!"
"Brightness has truth, Mengniu has purity"
It's not easy to use at all and the screen looks blurry. I keep having problems with it. It's the worst experience I've ever had when buying something.
Good quality and meets my requirements. Good quality and meets my requirements. Good quality and meets my requirements. Good quality and meets my requirements.
Delivery is too slow
"The game keeps crashing, I can’t contact customer service, and I haven’t been given an invoice. I’m really disappointed."
It’s too expensive. It’s 200 yuan more expensive than the physical store. I don’t know how to sell it for so much. I regret it so much.
"The mobile phone is okay and the Internet is pretty fast, but no invoice is issued!"
"Very dissatisfied! After a few days, I couldn’t even open the QQ game Landlord! ! !"
Very good. The goods have been received. The logistics is very good and the operation is very convenient.
The stuff is very good. I will come back again in the future.
"Twelve days after purchase, the speaker broke down and customer service was not available. I want to exchange the product and have filled out the repair and exchange form. When can I get a reply?"
"This time I bought the Huawei Enjoy 6 mobile phone on JD.com. I was so disappointed. The quality was so poor. I never used it after I bought it because the card couldn't be inserted. After I returned to my hometown and used it, I discovered that the color was wrong and there was a color difference."
"There is no one on the phone, no sign for delivery, it shows receipt, what the hell, bad review"
"Bought this for my wife, she likes large-screen mobile phones. She enjoys watching videos one word at a time!"
"Not bad, very good, I like it"
"The screen resolution is very good, the performance is stable, the style is beautiful, and it runs fast!"
Never buy Mengniu
"Whether you believe it or not, Mengniu itself doesn’t believe it anyway."
I've been using it for a while and it's okay. Very useful
"I just like Huawei, my colleagues all use this brand, this M3 is great, a tablet that can make phone calls! Like very much"
"~The size is suitable, the quality is very good, JD.com’s products are trustworthy~"
"The stuff is pretty good, pretty and the size is right"
"No way? I have been drinking Sanyuan recently. Mengniu and Yili are the most unreliable, and now Sanyuan is no longer reliable! Are there any reliable breasts? @Jing2003"
Still good.
The price is good and it’s good for the elderly.
"The hardware configuration is high, the appearance is good, and the edges are narrow. However, it is not suitable for holding in the hand and always accidentally touches it. It is very clear and smooth, and it is worth owning. The 4G running memory purchased for 2088 yuan, 32G."
"With a sigh, Mengniu is really sorry for the word ""cow"". This seems so exaggerated~~~ But Mengniu really needs to straighten things out! If Mengniu is not eliminated and the Chinese people are not strong, why are there still people drinking Mengniu? If Mengniu is not eliminated, the Chinese people will not be strong."
The dual-speaker Manhattan stereo makes it feel like having headphones on - great.
"Amplifying value is a good marketing strategy, similar to what Mengniu did back then."
"The goods have not been received. The JD.com website has already shown that it has been signed for, but I am still asked to evaluate it. Is it because the evaluation management is so poor and chaotic?"
"You get an instant discount of 100 when you buy it, and you get an instant discount of 200 just two days after you buy it. Also bundled with some useless stuff. . The mood is not beautiful. The phone is good,"
"The express delivery is fast, the machine is worth mentioning, and the packaging is high-end and exquisite at first glance. It is very fast to use. It is the first time to buy Huawei brand. I am really happy for the domestic brand. I support the big domestic brands."
"Very good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"Very good, the after-sales service came to your door very quickly to install it!"
"What I fear the most is dirty jokes, because I might laugh without reservation for a month. It affects the good mood of Mengniu Green that I cultivated because of the sadness of spring and autumn."
"The screen is slightly smaller, but it feels good in the hand and is very comfortable to use."
It feels used and the packaging is dirty. . The picture quality isn't that good either. .
Working for nothing!!! I’m so tired that I won’t love anymore ?_? @?? lit up Somalia’s little Mengniu and blew up Lao Hujun
"The screen is clear, the running speed is smooth, there are many software, and the sound is clear. It is worthy of this level and price."
It’s so easy to use. There’s no lag at all when playing games. It’s a bit dazzling when playing Honor of Kings. The screen looks like a 10-inch one.
"There was a bump above the breathing light, and the original paint was chipped off. I was really disappointed~~ I bought two mobile phones, both of which were second-hand~"
"Hello, is the charger you gave me original? Why is it always not fully charged?"
"I just got it and am still using it. The machine is good, but the feel is not great."
Two cut cakes are no match for one Mengniu.
"I still have electricity after I bought it, but it was slow to charge for the first time. This tempered film is not easy to buy."
"It feels very good in hand, very thin and light, the screen is very clear, the touch is very good, and the workmanship is also very exquisite. Domestic brands are on the rise."
"It hasn't been installed yet, the packaging is pretty solid, and the product looks okay."
"There is no free accessory, which is probably a false claim!"
It’s neither 618 nor Double Eleven. It takes three days for self-operated products to arrive? Has the express delivery business been outsourced? Is it no longer a pure JD Express?
Bought this for my father-in-law. The big screen is convenient for him to use and he can make calls. The system runs very smoothly.
It’s crazy that consumers found live bugs after drinking Mengniu milk (from http:t.cn/zWk74O6
Bought for my grandpa~ The stuff is good~~ Jingdong is still good~~ I support it
"It's so sad. This huge country can't even produce milk. How can it compete with Japan's scientific and technological capabilities? How sad! . It’s difficult to boycott Japanese goods, but it shouldn’t be that difficult to boycott Mengniu."
"Huawei brand, the quality is still good! Worth recommending!"
There is no problem with the mobile phone. I gave 1 star to the express delivery. The express delivery has really bad reviews. It was picked up by the express delivery on the 17th. I haven’t called today and I have to find out where I lost my things. It’s really funny.
"Not bad, good review! It would be nice if the price was lower"
"The stuff is good, but some customer service is terrible. Poor attitude and poor business skills. They deceive customers into buying goods."
"I bought it for an elderly person and am using it now, but I don’t know if it is helpful or not. Use it first"
"Damn it, I don’t want to buy anything on JD.com anymore. What kind of discount package, but the sizes are different? Is this misleading consumers?"
The sound quality is very good and the sound is loud
"Why is there no invoice? If you bought it from a self-operated store, there should definitely be one. Why not? Now I really question JD.com."
"Except for fingerprint recognition, this phone is not good at all, and it is just like an older phone."
"The express delivery was too slow. I promised it would arrive the next day, but I ended up waiting for several days. The contact numbers given by customer service were all empty."
"Good reviews, very satisfied"
"It still works without WiFi, but freezes when connected to WiFi. One star is too much for me."
"I don’t want to pay a cent. The goods haven’t arrived, so how can I sign for them? Where is the goods?"
My wife and daughter are quite satisfied with using it and it is cost-effective. Looking forward to Huawei’s more cost-effective products
"Not bad, just the right size and good sound quality"
Bought for dad! Dad is very satisfied! happy!
"This battery is not good, it takes a long time to turn on"
"If you don’t have an invoice, you won’t get one even if you ask for one! The machine is too long, doesn’t feel good, and is uncomfortable to hold! The font does not match the machine! There is no film left from the factory! All in all, the shopping experience was very poor this time!"
My wife likes it very much. I bought it as a birthday gift for her. The logistics was fast.
"The stuff is pretty good. The layout is very nice. Although the resolution is not high, the price is worth it. It’s for the elderly to watch videos. It’s also fine for myself."
"The quality of the mobile phone is okay, but the standard configuration is too bad, there are no headphones, and the service attitude is also drunk. I am really speechless. I don’t believe it anymore. It’s so rubbish."
Easy to use and fast delivery
The battery is not durable and the standby time is just over a day. I am speechless.
My husband chose it and I think it’s okay. JD.com delivers quickly
"If the battery is bad, it won’t last a day."
"The courier company delivers the goods immediately, continue shopping on JD.com"
"Jingdong is unhappy about this, but there are no negative reviews"
Not even a video member will give you a bad review
"Just a few days after I bought it, the price was reduced, and I refused to refund my money, giving various excuses. It’s rubbish, I advise you not to buy it."
It crashed after only two months. The seller is not kind.
"After two days, the screen went black"
"I got it, and I am very satisfied with it, especially the resolution and sound effects. They are really great. The appearance and workmanship are also very exquisite. It is very comfortable to hold and the size is just right. Huawei is indeed trustworthy and has good reviews. ."
"Good, good, good, good"
"Leather case, earphones, membrane, etc.,,, nothing comes as a gift, just a charger. Every time I go home, I have to turn on and off the WF on the tablet again to connect. It cannot connect automatically. The sound quality is good and the sound is loud."
Say no to Mengniu! Say no to unscrupulous companies! Be with you
I just used it. It is exactly the same as my phone. It is only two sizes larger than mine. It is a bit expensive.
"The phone is very good and easy to use, and the delivery speed is also very fast."
"The price/performance ratio is very high, and it can be used with mobile 4G networks. Huawei is worthy of everyone's trust."
"Bought for an old man, very good thing!"
"Under my influence, everyone in my family switched from Apple to Huawei phones. But this one is really bad, very blurry and pixelated. This heart is for JD Express! So fast!"
"The most disappointing shopping experience, the tablet is not good, the touch screen is often stuck and unresponsive, I regret it."
"Trust Huawei, Huawei for mobile phones. I also decided to choose Huawei for my tablet. When I got it in my hand, it felt good. I tried the sound effects and was very satisfied. Because I only use it to watch videos and browse the web. Considering the price/performance ratio, it's pretty good."
"The large Mengniu fruit here sells for nine yuan! ! ! My favorite big fruit, I can no longer date you often. It seems that we are not suitable for each other. Let’s break up."
Dameng Niu Sour Yogurt #Fortunately we have Su Miaoling#
"Bought for my mother, not bad"
"Your sister Huawei, the screen definition is so bad, I regret it"
"It runs very fast and has no problem playing Honor of Kings, but charging is a bit slow."
"I drink yogurt here and there, but I still like Mengniu’s red date yogurt the most. It tastes delicious and is cheap."
Very useful. good
Not bad. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"This tablet is very rubbish. If you want to play games, don't buy it. You can only watch a video. After purchasing, the customer service will ignore you. I asked the customer service many times to see if they are there, but no one responded. The price has been greatly reduced. I suggest you buy it with caution."
"Ah~ah, when I first got it, I found that the upper right corner was worn. This was just received. Could it be that it has been used? Very bad review!"
"The mobile phone is very good, great. I give it five stars. Thank you boss and wish you a prosperous business."
"I finally got it. I like it very much. It is better and clearer than the previous 8-inch tablet. The size is also what I want. The delivery is very fast, which is great."
"Bah, shameless Mengniu, even more shameless @Ranxiang."
"After booting, there should be 11G of space and 70% of the memory remaining. If you trust Huawei, you can buy another Huawei phone and try it."
"Quality is good, speed is fast, good"
"The current usage condition is pretty good. JD.com’s yield rate is commendable. If you want to buy it, you can do it."
"The quality is super poor, the standby time is very short, and if I don’t watch videos, the battery will run out overnight and it will automatically shut down. Very bad. I regret buying Huawei. After all, the quality is not good enough."
Not bad. Logistics has always been pretty good.
"?I am not Mengniu, and I am not as pure as you think. --Are you going to be so sarcastic? Mengniu is so embarrassed. . ."
"Jingdong’s after-sales service is rubbish, this model is only 799 yuan on Huawei’s official website mall."
I just got it today. It’s pretty good. I like it very much.
"The WIFI signal of the mobile phone in the same place is stable, but the WIFI of the tablet I bought keeps dropping out and cannot be used at all. I contacted customer service several times, but no one paid attention. It is my first time to buy something on JD.com, and the service is incomparable with Taob."
"The phone works well, Huawei’s quality is really good"
"Bought for the company, not bad"
Why is the screen display so bad? Not as good as mobile phone
I bought it for an elderly person. Fast delivery. The screen size is just right. I can still make calls with 50% battery. It’s so fresh. Huawei is doing a really good job. It supports state-owned brands.
nice one! It runs fast and the screen is clear! Fast logistics and good service!
"Mengniu. Good, good, I still see that side of you on stage. Graduation fall, happy graduation, have a good time. I’ll save you a meal@Flying Mengniu"
Bad review Absolutely bad review
"It's okay to use, the running speed is neither fast nor slow, the photography is average, and the appearance is passable."
I am very satisfied with the baby received. The size is suitable and the speed is fast. I trust the JD.com self-operated store and I bought many things there. The logistics is also very good. I placed the order in the morning and it arrived in the afternoon.
Delivery boy can't
Boycotting Mengniu is like boycotting Japanese goods
"The sound quality is so amazing that it makes the gods and ghosts weep! The battery is still unclear, so I’ll make do with it and it’ll be pretty good!"
It feels great and the screen size is suitable for playing games and watching movies. It’s my first time using Huawei and it feels no worse than fruit.
It’s really good. I saw the machine in a physical store. I fell in love with it at first sight. I caught up with JD for an event and bought it immediately. . . great love
"No headphones at all, it’s rubbish"
"Huawei tablets are easy to use, and the sensitivity and response are very fast. I like it very much and I recommend everyone to buy it..."
It’s a good thing and it feels good. It’s a good thing and it feels good. It’s a good thing and it feels good. It’s a good thing and it feels good.
"The quality of JD.com products is guaranteed, the after-sales service is good, and the express delivery is fast."
"One bag of Mengniu breakfast milk every day at noon, yes, it is breakfast milk; yes, it is Mengniu!"
"Very easy to use, the screen is clear, Harman Kardon is good, but the protective film is difficult to apply"
Mengniu really don’t dare to drink anymore. Repost on Weibo
"No invoice, the courier guy is very helpful."
"It's high-end, the sound effects are great, and the battery needs to be improved. Fast delivery!"
"The portable tablet is cheap and good-looking, and has enough memory. It can be used for watching TV, chatting on WeChat, and playing small games."
I feel like the screen is not very flexible. I don’t know if it’s a film problem.
"Good, very good. Big phone panel. So cool. 7-inch big screen."
I drank Mengniu pure milk and found it delicious.
"Too thick, poor resolution. Everything looks like a mosaic."
"Fast logistics and considerate service! The tablet is very light, fast, and cheaper than **. It would be great if it comes with a leather case! ! !"
"The SIM card slot is broken, why? After getting the machine, I couldn't open the card slot."
"The machine is pretty good, but what about the promised card delivery? Where's the card?"
"Negative reviews are necessary. To be honest, if I had known that the black borders were so wide, I would not have bought it from JD.com. It would be too troublesome to return it. In addition, JD.com did not give any free gifts when I bought it during the Chinese New Year. I had to pay for it myself*. Protective case."
"Stylish appearance, clear screen, smooth and stable system, and durable battery~~~"
"The milk in the company canteen actually comes from Mengniu and Yili, which is so cheating. . . I want morning light. . ."
not very good
"Very good, big brand performs well in all aspects"
"Very bad, is this worth it! The screen is very uncomfortable to touch, and the resolution is very poor. Huawei phones are pretty good, but why are tablets so bad? Is it genuine?"
I really feel like I’ve been cheated. Why does it crash when playing games? It’s normal when fully charged. Why is the battery draining so fast? It really needs improvement.
"Great value for money, pretty good. The water heater installed by the neighbor is very good. In short, I am satisfied. Thank you to the seller for your enthusiastic service. I will introduce my family and friends to buy your home in the future. Business is booming."
"Too many surprises, too many surprises, the sound is so beautiful, but the only drawback is that the screen has black borders"
The gift I gave to my client’s child turned out to be unopened. I was very disappointed.
"Looks good, my wife likes it and likes it"
Silent electronic invoices. The packaging is a mess. The appearance of the prototype is terrible. An enlarged version of mate seven.
"Very good, it is very convenient for mom to use"
"I stopped drinking milk a long time ago. Boycott unscrupulous companies and ""Mengniu"", starting from me!"
"This price/performance ratio is pretty good. I’ve been eyeing it for a long time. When it was 200 cheaper, I quickly placed an order. It also came with a leather case. My mom said it was okay."
"It’s just that the Android system is harder to use than Apple’s, but the machine is still fine."
Are you happy using it? No other questions yet
"The screen resolution is poor, not as cost-effective as small domestic brands, and the packaging is also broken. . . Unable to complain."
Is Mengniu’s Weibo marketing department SB? Is cutting cakes a compliment? It seems that drinking too much Mengniu is bad for your brain.
"You can't repair it, and you won't be able to retreat if you retreat. It's really a trap."
It looks good. JD.com’s express delivery service is very good and fast. All the mobile phones at home are Huawei and they support domestic products.
Placed an order yesterday and received the item today! I like JD Logistics. I feel very good. I like it very much. I support Huawei and domestic products! !
What a great machine. I bought it for my mother. It’s so big that it doesn’t bother the eyes at all.
"The resolution is terrible, the screen is too sensitive, and it takes too long to charge!"
"Very good, I like it very much. The interest-free installment plan in six installments is very impressive. I have been paying attention to it for a long time and finally got what I wanted at 618."
"The mobile phone has high resolution. Ultra-thin, not heavy, no lag when playing Honor of Kings. Very good so far"
"Bluetooth doesn't work and can't be found. I'm so angry. The resolution is really not high. If I had money, I would buy an Apple."
"Trust JD.com to be self-operated, provide fast after-sales service, guarantee original and authentic products, and the delivery guy is fast and has a good attitude."
"Dormitory benefits, a bottle of Mengniu"
The screen is clear and the size is suitable. It is easy to play with pesticides and supports domestic products.
Too harsh on Mengniu
"Fingerprint unlocking is very fast, almost as good as Mate9."
"Bought for an elderly person, the screen is large, clear, simple and practical."
I love milk ~ I drink it every day ~ but is Mengniu safe? ~~~
"Yes, there are no problems when I get it, and there is no lag when playing Honor (this is also related to the fast Internet speed), but the 8.4-inch screen is a bit big for me, and it is good for watching TV."
I just got it not long ago. It looks very good and the workmanship is also very good. I like it very much! The boot system was upgraded to EMUI5.0. I fiddled with it a few times and it was pretty smooth. I plan to play the game and try it again later. I am very satisfied so far!
No negative reviews on headphones
"Less than a month after I bought it, it started to freeze when playing games, and the response was too slow. . . I found this problem temporarily, I will take a look after using it for a few months, and I will add comments later."
The Internet is not very fast and is a bit stuck.
I'm very satisfied. I know it very well. The express delivery arrived quickly and within a day. I like it.
"The pixel is not as good as expected, and it runs as fast as expected. My dad is determined to buy it. He just needs to use it well."
"Fast delivery, good experience"
"Yes, the elderly at home use it well and like it. The price is very affordable."
gpu is too bad
"Another illiterate! Go->As! ! ! The most disgusting tiramisu in history, why don’t you go to Mengniu Dairy Brick?"
"The first time I bought a Huawei mobile phone, my experience was not very good. Among mobile phones of the same price, there is a gap in quality between Huawei mobile phones."
It’s really big and the quality is very good
"Be careful, everyone~ The quality of Mengniu’s products is really worrying!"
"Slow response, screen sometimes does not respond, often freezes, no invoices"
"Eating ice cream in winter is the way to go. I have never been fond of Mengniu, but I like Lao Popsicle very much. The taste of childhood, which cost a dime fifteen years ago, now costs two yuan..."
It's rubbish. My parents only used it for less than two months and the receiver broke. Still stuck like crazy.
"Shipping is fast, order in the morning and arrive in the evening"
"Self-operated things must be praised? Trust JD.com, you get what you pay for."
"A very bad experience, the packaging is too crude. None have any sealed packaging. Too lazy to retreat again."
"To be honest, Huawei is so stupid. I don’t understand how this brand got promoted. The quality is too poor. I haven’t even used it yet. I can’t hear the speaker. It’s rubbish."
I have stopped buying Mengniu for a long time
very good! Very convenient to use!
The machine is very smooth to use and cost-effective
"HD new, super great, runs smoothly. I believe in Huawei’s strength. Come on."
"Genuine product, this is my second time to buy it, and the installation was good."
Good quality and durable.
"It looks good, and I agree with it after using it."
Continue to boycott Mengniu and change the main visual to cut off the negative image? What way?
"Bad review, Honor of Kings really can't carry it around and the card bursts. I regret it so much. I can't return it after half a month. I want to change it but I don't know how. Don't buy it when playing games. It's stuck. It's a garbage tablet."
It's pretty good. I bought one from the official website and another one from JD.com for my mother. The effect and speed are both good.
Why didn't you give me a protective cover and tempered film?
"It looks beautiful and the 9.6 size is quite large. Huawei's quality, although the configuration is not high, the workmanship is not bad, I am very satisfied;"
Not bad. I have used it for a while before reviewing it. It is really good. Huawei quality is trustworthy.
"There is no punishment or loss for cheating in China. It’s OK to find a backer. The same goes for Mengniu. High-profile punishment with the front foot, low-key promotion with the back foot. If this continues, where is the hope? ""Now finally it's there""!"
"Bad review, really bad, not ordinary bad, don't buy this product, it's just a bare machine, marked with a case and tempered film, but nothing else."
"Very nice stuff. I like it very much, the price is very good. Fast delivery"
"If you have never bought Mengniu, you can’t buy it from Mengniu! What can I eat now? There are safety hazards everywhere. Please do not buy Mengniu products."
"Bought for a 90-year-old man, very good, very satisfied"
"Currently using it, very satisfied"
It’s fast and the screen is clear! It’s just that the black border is a bit big
The product is much better than I expected. The picture quality is also very good and clear. The price is super cost-effective.
"Only 30%, too little. # cherish the life, reject Mengniu#, I won’t even eat popsicles from his store # FMCG headlines # Mengniu’s negative reports caused sales to drop by 30%?"
A cup of Mengniu will poison the Chinese people. Tell Mengniu to die.
I didn’t expect Huawei to be so good for a few hundred yuan. It seems I can’t be superstitious about foreign brands anymore.
"It said there was a free gift, but it turned out there wasn't. Don't want to comment anymore"
"The pixels are too poor, I’m not satisfied!"
"SB dropped the price as soon as I bought it, damn Huawei"
I despise Mengniu’s milk and I have been boycotting it for a long time!
I've been using it for a while and it's very good.
"Very good, my friends like it very much, membership plus is great"
"I can’t play the things I want to play. It doesn’t feel very good. The pixels are low. The results promised to be delivered the next day cannot be delivered. I contacted customer service, but the customer service ignored me. This is the first negative review."
"The quality is average, the power consumption is too high, and it is difficult to use?"
Real warriors drink ten barrels of Mengniu to support national milk
It took me a while to evaluate it. The product is good and the price is right. It is eight inches and easy to carry. The packaging is very poor. It is just the packaging box inside the carton. The space in the carton is empty. There is no anti-collision thing at all. The sound quality is good and the battery is okay.
The after-sales installation master will know if the back is uneven on the wall.
Bought this for my dad. He likes it very much. The same style is several hundred cheaper than in the physical store. The courier’s service attitude is super good. High praise!
Been using it for a while and it feels good. This configuration is enough.
"The stuff is very good, very cost-effective, worth buying"
The baby has been received. It’s pretty good. The logistics was great.
"The price was reduced by ** yuan less than a week after I bought it, and the price difference was not compensated. What kind of credibility is it? This is the first time I feel that JD.com is so unreliable. Today is only the 20th. I placed an order on the 14th and I feel like I was scammed. And The cell phone battery is too small"
"It works well, it clears quickly, I like it very much!"
"No, no, no, no, it’s really not good, I was fooled"
The quality is average. I bought only three pieces but the price was reduced twice. It was very difficult to make up the price difference. I give it one star.
This is not the first time Mengniu has had problems. I personally will boycott all products of this unscrupulous company forever!
"This thing is hard to explain, buy with caution"
"Not bad, the stuff is very good"
Rubbish. Regret buying it. The quality is not good either
"It runs very smoothly, no lag at all ~ very easy to use"
"I bought it for my family. It feels good and suitable for the elderly. Although the space is not big, it is enough!"
"Why do you make me, a Mengniu fan, so stupid?"
"Very beautiful, great for playing games on the big screen"
"It’s already very cheap compared to Yilimeng Niu, so be content! Can't afford to drink anymore"
It’s still worth it. Huawei is the pride of the Chinese people. Great!?
It’s a second-hand phone. The battery doesn’t hold up well. It’s a bummer.
You won’t know until you buy it whether it’s good or not. Mushrooms are blue and thin!
The big black border is not pleasing to the eye. I’m not my type. I don’t feel it’s good at all.
"The delivery speed is really slow, people waiting are anxious to death"
"Very good, for watching TV series"
"This phone is really speechless. After only a few days of use, the screen is all white or there are no visible stripes on the screen. I am really speechless."
It’s okay. Playing Honor of Kings is quite smooth. I’m looking forward to future versions.
"Rubbish Jingdong platform, rubbish Jingdong customer service, resolute return, Chacha Chacha"
Not bad. The quality of Midea is great. The water heats up very quickly. I’ll buy a bigger one in a few days. I’ll have time to upload photos.
Huawei’s phones are pretty good. Good reviews.
The items are average and the logistics is terrible!
"Why do they all have mobile phone cases? Why do I only have one earphone? What's going on? But when I got the phone, it was fine."
"There is no invoice. After 16 days of use, the phone's response is getting slower and slower... The time for return or exchange has expired..."
"Yes, there is no lag at all when playing Honor of Kings"
"The workmanship is fine, the Kirin 930 processor is very responsive, and there is no lag. Nothing to be dissatisfied with at the moment."
"I haven’t had time to review it yet. It’s good. It runs fast, has high resolution, and the battery is durable. I’m quite satisfied with it. Good review."
"Before buying, I clearly saw that it came with a protective case and film, but when I received the goods, there was nothing. I contacted customer service and said that this product did not come with gifts, which deceived customers."
"After taking it apart, there were fingerprints on the surface of the screen and on the plastic film of the charger. The experience of the machine was poor and the smearing was severe. I couldn’t stand it when I browsed Weibo to read text and pictures. No other problems were found yet. All in all, it was a failed purchase."
"I originally bought it for my mother, but why can the elderly only use it for a day and a half after fully charging the 4100mAh large-capacity battery and only making and receiving calls? Is it an official transfer? Why are the same model prices on other websites so low now? Solve."
I only bought it a month ago and it started to freeze. I pressed the return button and there was no response for a long time. This phone is so rubbish. I will never buy this brand of phone again.
Have a can of authentic Mengniu yogurt
"Thanks to the second-hand dealer who finally took back a second-hand tablet a week after placing the order, and mailed it to me immediately. I was so moved that I almost cried. Second hand stuff, you deserve it. The courier boy is innocent."
"The seller promised to send a film, but why didn’t it come with it? Everything else is fine and very practical."
"Nothing to say about the tablet, it’s great! Worth buying. Why do I give a bad review? The main reason is that the logistics is too slow. It took a whole week to go."
It feels good. The delivery is fast.
"The appearance, feel, and processor are good, but they heat up easily."
"You get what you pay for, garbage tablet"
"The appearance looks good. I bought it for the elderly. It is economical and practical. However, it is troublesome to assemble the case and film. It is recommended to buy it directly online."
"Huawei’s mobile phones are very good, JD’s service is good, JD supports it"
"Overall, the experience was excellent. Great sound quality"
It’s only 30%. It seems that the power of public opinion is not strong enough... # FMCG headlines # Did Mengniu’s negative reports cause sales to drop by 30%?
Card a piece of junk
"The service is very poor, the tablet has no film, and the case sent is rubbish and does not protect the back. The only 5 stars left is the logistics, which is really fast."
What do you mean? The screen freezes and the screen freezes. The screen becomes black.
"You can't make phone calls, but it works pretty well"
"I received the goods the night before yesterday. When I went to apply the film today, I discovered that the screen is curved and there is always a corner of the tempered film that cannot be applied."
"Liu Xiang, let’s not run away. From now on, we will drink Coca-Cola instead of Pepsi, Yili instead of Mengniu, buy Nike instead of Adidas, and use Amway Nutrilite for health care products. It's okay, we'll take care of you. Reposted from: Renren Netizen."
"The customer service deceived people. They clearly said that there was a gift, and when I took the photo, it also showed that there was a gift. I took the photo, but when I got the tablet, there was no gift. They also said that it could not be solved while supplies lasted. It was so disgusting."
"Damn it, Jingdong didn’t even issue an invoice"
"It sucks. I really doubt it is a fake. After using it for less than a month, it often has no ringtone for no reason!"
It's a good idea and can be used like a mobile phone
I just used it. The resolution is not very high and the camera is not clear. I don’t know what happened.
The phone tablet doesn’t come with headphones or a protective film?
"It's too laggy and freezes when playing, leaving me speechless. It's cheap but it's not easy to get a loan."
"This is my first time buying, it’s very good, but they don’t give me a protective case?"
"Well, I am Mengniu who loves listening to music."
"The product is rubbish, the network cannot be connected, the product is not exchanged, and it does not comply with the national three-guarantee policy."
"Bought for my father, it is very good and powerful, Huawei is the number one domestic brand! Go global!"
Dad used it and said it was very good and gave him good reviews.
The appearance is okay. Let’s take a look at the system and memory. It feels good. Are you planning to buy a keyboard and mouse?
I won’t buy from JD.com next time if I have bad reviews. Others sell their used mobile phones.
"The reason why I gave it one star is very simple: Zhuxian Game will have an event on the 18th. If you buy it, you will get virtual game items for free. I bought it 2 days early. Back it up! Now I really want to return it and buy it again to get a gift package."
Very satisfied with it.
"Not bad, but I’m not satisfied with the lack of a mobile phone case. The phone is still fine and worth buying."
"The screen is big enough, and the functions are the same as those of Huawei phones. Without Wi-Fi, it is useless and doesn’t feel very good. ."
"Let’s take a look, there is nothing except the charger, nothing is downloaded in the tablet, and the available memory is only 4G. I don’t know what the problem is."
"If you don’t drink Mengniu, I haven’t drank Mengniu for a long time. If you drink Yili, don’t worry about it. As for whether you drink it or not, I don’t drink it anyway."
"I went and bought it the day before yesterday. It was more than 100 yuan cheaper today, so I sold it separately. Forget it, there is no membrane or earphones. Is the product shipped fake?"
"Mengniu is so bad. Damn, I haven’t had it for a long time! Once again, I am determined to never take another sip of Mengniu again! Boycott again! Resolutely boycott Mengniu! Stay away from any Mengniu products!"
"It's too bad. It's just a phone with nothing, not even a film. The things that were promised will not be delivered. Bad review, bad review, bad review! !"
The touch screen is not easy to use and the virtual buttons never work. Regret buying it.
I have already bought 3 units of this phablet on JD.com. They were all purchased for my work leaders. They all said it is very useful.
"It’s been a month since I bought it, but the screen keeps jumping for no reason, and even restoring it to factory settings doesn’t improve it! Is this the quality that the Huawei brand should have?"
"The machine is okay, but the delivered items are not delivered! Don’t talk about bad credit reviews! The courier guy is awesome!"
"Baby received. Let me just say that it is very easy to use, the picture is clear, the volume is good, and it looks good when I take it out. It is worth buying this time."
"I have stopped buying Mengniu and Yili a long time ago. I have abandoned Mengniu a long time ago, and so has Yili! The most shameless one is Mengniu, please boycott it"
"As for games, I don’t know because I don’t play games."
It’s not bad. The price and product are right. It only costs a few hundred yuan. It’s not too demanding. I bought it for my grandma and she is very satisfied!
"What is this? It's just rubbish. Not counting the slow Internet access, the screen resolution is too low. Can't even connect to wireless,"
I just received the goods. I will try it for a few days before reviewing. Please give me a five-star review first.
It’s okay. I gave it a try and it runs smoothly. It’s great for watching movies.
"Bought it on Double Eleven, the price is great, and it looks big enough!"
"I haven’t drank Meng milk for a long time. The continuous quality problems have made me unable to trust it, so now I only buy Yili milk! ."
"This is my third purchase, trustworthy"
# Mengniu Sour Yogurt Newcomer Festival# My voice is hoarse...all kinds of excitement...all kinds of satisfaction...
"For home use, it's okay"
"The response speed is okay, the screen is big, you can answer calls, and it’s great for playing games for the elderly."
It's big enough and convenient to use.
"The phone is good, damn it. It was fully charged in the morning, but it was gone at noon. I’m very disappointed. I can’t carry a power bank with me wherever I go..."
It’s so dishonest. The price was reduced within 2 days of placing the order*. Please consult customer service. They will kick the ball first and then no one will deal with the lottery. It’s too busy and rubbish.
"The order has been issued and shipped, but Jingdong canceled the contract without authorization, eliminated the order information, eliminated the evidence, did not notify the buyer, did not admit its mistake, lied, and talked nonsense. Does such a company have a reputation for scientific research? Can it have genuine products?"
"Disgusting, not worth it at all. The response is so slow. The price was reduced right after I bought it. I’m so unhappy."
"Very good, satisfied with the price"
"Hahahaha, I would also like to thank the endorsement merchants such as Xtep, Pepsi, Mengniu Zhuifeng and Nokia for their continuous promotion and encouragement during the voting period."
"You get what you pay for, nothing comes as a gift, I feel it’s okay and it’s worthy of the price!"
"If the barcode cannot be scanned, is it fake?"
"Jingdong's express delivery is *^fast^*. It arrived in the afternoon after placing the order at 11am. The overall feeling is okay. The change rate is a bit low, and the price is right."
JD Logistics delivers very quickly and the items are very good. Save
It's easy to use and I'm quite satisfied.
This is a crazy thing. Domestic Mengniu Yili’s public relations capabilities should not be too strong. Be careful to make the minister step down!
"We promised to deliver it to your door, but it was not delivered to the town. If you can't do it, don't promise it. I'm very disappointed."
"The logistics speed is fast, the machine runs very smoothly, and the battery is very powerful. It can be used for two days without playing games. It took me two months to evaluate it."
Watching the movie was really unclear and speechless. One star for the courier guy.
My son likes it very much. The price/performance ratio is quite high.
Mengniu should close down. Mengniu should die.
"The arrival was very fast and the product was well packaged. Although I haven't had time to install and use it yet, because a friend is using this model, the quality is guaranteed."
good! fine
Mengniu and Yili won’t eat it! This kind of black-hearted factory should close down soon! Just wait and see what happens.
"Ordered through 618, it goes without saying that it is genuine and the price is cheaper than all stores! Worth buying!"
"I bought it for someone else, but don’t have the promised gift? I’m not happy."
"The price was reduced after buying it, which is really unkind. There are also free memory cards and data cables, and I only have a bare metal!"
What else can I say? Bad review! One star is too many!
"Every time I finish breakfast in the canteen, I feel thirsty. You can imagine how much MSG I was given. Suddenly I want to drink frozen Mengniu Premium C. What kind of work are you doing overtime today? Can you help me buy it?"
"JD.com, as always, Huawei is trustworthy."
"The resolution is too low and it feels very low. I don’t recommend buying it. When buying a tablet, you can check out Intel chips, which are great value. In addition, the resolution must reach 1080p, otherwise it will look unclear."
"Good stuff, worth having!"
"I have been using the pad for a few days, and it feels good, very smooth, looks beautiful, and is not particularly heavy. I like it very much and am very satisfied! The delivery was very fast, it was delivered on the same day."
"Authentic product, easy to use, great service"
"Just got it, not sure if it's good or not"
The screen doesn't even have a protective film.
"The audio effect is great, the 2k screen has good clarity, but the screen response is slow and dragging is laggy. The Kirin 950 CPU has average speed on the m3 and is not as smooth as the mobile phone."
"A very good quality tablet. Huawei products are of high quality and low price, and are trustworthy."
The baby has just been received and has not been used yet. The logistics is very fast and the country roads deliver it to me personally. The service is excellent.
"I've used it, it's good, it's pretty good~~"
"Yes, it is very good in all aspects. It is a domestic brand that I have always trusted. I hope it can do better!"
Good. . . . . . .
"The delivery service is very poor, very poor. How can JD.com use such people? Their attitude is not good at all."
I have stopped drinking Mengniu for a long time!
I bought it yesterday and the price was reduced today.
"Overall very good, relatively smooth"
The smoothness is good and the delivery is fast.
It’s a good one. It’s a good product that I chose by myself.
"Sorry, I'm evil. The sour sentences from Mengniu scared me."
"The phone is okay, but it doesn’t come with a headphone cable, which makes me feel helpless. I bought it for the elderly. I bought three units for the Huawei brand. I will review it later."
"It’s a phone for seniors. It’s pretty good, but I don’t know if it’s a problem with the cover or the phone itself. There’s no sensor switch screen."
"Very good, looks like an enlarged version of a mobile phone"
"Crisis public relations and crisis management are things we should study seriously. Sanlu, Mengniu, and McDonald’s incidents are the best cases."
"Damn it, express delivery is so slow. It took 9 days and I’m so fucked."
"The product is good, so it matches the description"
Boycott Mengniu! Unscrupulous businessman!
It’s strange that people still drink Meng milk! Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu!
"Huawei is a good brand, the products are of high quality and low price, the delivery is timely, the appearance is complete, the use is relatively smooth, and the picture quality is good."
...I can't drink Mengniu milk...I feel sick after drinking it for two days in a row...I feel super uncomfortable...Black-hearted Mengniu! ! Go to hell! ! !
"Two days after I replaced it, there were two small scratches on the back of the phone. I don’t know if it was caused by me or if it was already there. Forget it. I had to slide repeatedly to unlock the phone. When entering the software, the screen went black and I had to log out and then enter again. I was drunk and could only give it to the bad guy. comment"
"Very good machine, easy to use and cost-effective"
I can connect to the Internet but I can't connect to the Internet. I'm fine playing with my phone. It always says that the signal is poor and the connection is not strong. I don't know if it needs to be replaced.
"Not long after I bought it, the price dropped*. I was so depressed."
9.17 is also a big day for the Wang family~~~I’m really happy today~I look forward to it being broadcast on TV soon~Mengniu Sour Yoghurt Music Chart is awesome~
The stuff is very good. I really like it. I will come again next time.
You get what you pay for...nothing outstanding and no obvious shortcomings.
"Very easy to use, delivery speed is also very fast"
"Must give a negative review! ! ! ! During the 11th day of November, the price was the lowest every day (to put it nicely). I bought it for a week. When I saw it on November 10th, I saw that the price had dropped*, and I couldn’t guarantee the price even if I paid for it! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"The size is suitable, the sound quality is good, and it is enough for watching videos. I like it on JD Express."
The phone doesn’t lag. It’s much better than what I’m using.
Fast! Attentive service! Very powerful! ! The machine runs fast!
"Mengniu’s event was very creative, and the happiness and beauty instantly infected my little heart."
"It's adequate, practical, easy to use, and has a decent battery life of more than six hours."
"Not bad, okay, pretty good"
"Bad review, only used it for a week and the screen cracked on its own."
It's stuck. Rubbish
It's very smooth to use and the sound system is very good. I'll evaluate it after using it for a while.
The mobile phone is of good quality. I bought it for a relative.
The quality is not that great. Jingdong’s products are getting worse and worse
"The resolution is too poor, not as good as a mobile phone, so I dare not show it to my children. The hardware is also poor and cannot play flash. If I had known, I would have paid a few hundred more to buy the Huawei eight-core model. Forget it, I decided not to return it and ordered a new one from Apple. Huawei is so disappointing."
"The goods are very poor and the game is hard to run and looks bad. There are still some flaws, and I feel like I paid for a refurbished phone, but they got nothing as a gift."
"Huawei's quality is indeed good, the tablet system is easy to use, and the quality is very good!"
"Very satisfied, the product is very good and easy to use. ."
"The quality is good, give it a thumbs up. Friends who support the product want to buy it after seeing it. Highly recommended."
"Logistics is great, everything is perfect, I can use it to watch movies and learn a lot."
I bought it for my kids and it seems ok.
I don't think it's genuine. I haven't used it since I bought it. I just left it there. I took it out two days ago and found that the photo was very unnatural. I'm going to take it to Huawei after-sales service for maintenance. I guess it's an assembled machine. I can't return it now. I admit it.
"The system is smooth, runs fast, and the screen is clear. The sound quality is good, very satisfied"
Very average Very average Very average
"Even though I didn’t deliver what I promised, JD.com pushed Huawei, and Huawei pushed JD.com."
No headphones! There is no tempered glass film! Not cost-effective! The photo is not clear!
"If you have some credit cards and money, buy expensive ones."
"I don’t know if the product is useless, but the logistics is really unpleasant!"
The express delivery was slower than a snail. I had to wait for almost a week.
"It’s okay, after all, the price is there, it’s enough for my mother! Huawei quality is trustworthy!"
"Both plug-in card and wireless network are available, which is very cost-effective."
"It doesn't feel good, it gets hot easily, and it runs slower when it gets hot."
"I have been using it for 10 days. Sorry for the late review. The effect is pretty good. The sound quality is in line with expectations. Overall, I am quite satisfied with it. All five stars."
"I bought the third one, good quality, stable and smooth operation, recommended"
"Good quality and low price, you get what you pay for, the elderly have a good experience using it"
"Damn, the price was reduced just after I bought it."
"For such unscrupulous companies, such as Liuhe, KFC, Mengniu, etc., wouldn't another apology be enough to solve the problem? Those responsible should be brought to justice and the company should be severely punished."
The item has been used for a period of time and the effect is very poor. Misoperation is too serious.
"It works fine. Only evaluated now. I feel that the resolution of the tablet is a bit low, but everything else is good."
I bought it for a friend. He used it for a day and said it works well.
This is my first time buying Huawei brand products. I will tell you after using them.
"Very good, kids like it very much"
"Just received it, the resolution is good. fast"
"Not bad, it’s worth the money. I bought it for my wife to watch TV dramas. If she likes it, it’s good."
"There is a bug in the system. After answering the phone and hanging up, it freezes and becomes unresponsive!"
"No, we don’t even have basic earplugs. The system is lagging behind."
"It was 200 off just three days after I bought it, and it’s champagne gold. I’m drunk too."
"Not very satisfied. LeTV members and invoices, nothing but a tablet."
I'm hungry in the morning. I only have a box of Mengniu real fruit grains. I can only look at the delicious food in the magazine to satisfy my hunger... I'm hungry and my mouth is watering. What should I do?
"In one sentence, it’s too bad and I want to return it."
"Not bad, not bad, not bad! The tablet is very thick. Great tablet, worth the price! Support domestic products!"
"Have been using it, good, very good, very good"
The phone was unresponsive and overheated. I tried to return it several times but failed to do so. The factory repairs took too long and there was no replacement phone.
"Huawei m3 is good to use, but the wifi version cannot insert a card. But connecting to wireless network is very useful"
"Very good, the screen is big, my father-in-law likes it very much"
The appearance is very beautiful. I bought it for my mother. The big screen makes it easier to watch TV series.
"Boycott Japanese goods, boycott Mengniu. Mengniu is in such a bad state, rely on your sister! I don’t want to drink Mengniu even if I have change!"
"Opening the package, the screen-to-body ratio is really small! A circle of black edges! After using it for a day, it got stuck three or four times! ! Returns are too troublesome! Not recommended to hold"
"Very good, the screen is awesome and clear. The sound quality feels like listening to headphones. It is very suitable for a tablet for audio-visual entertainment. It is no worse than an iPad. It runs very fast and 3D games generally run smoothly."
I don’t want to say that this is the worst thing I have ever bought. It has scratches and the buttons are faulty.
I'm using it now. I haven't figured out many functions yet. It's very smooth and I'm very satisfied with it.
Is it to protect Mengniu?
"Bad review, the worst purchase ever, poor service, even promised to give a leather case but refused to give it. It's better to go to the store and buy it directly."
"Yes, if the application is not open, it will enter sleep mode as long as it is not operated."
"The screen is broken. I feel really bad. I thought the tempered film was broken. After I peeled it off, I found that the screen was broken. It was really a broken screen. Huawei screens are so rubbish."
The price dropped as soon as I bought it. It was the most failed transaction in my life.
"It's very good. It's for children. The delivery is very fast, which is unexpected!"
"A box of six walnuts, a box of Deluxe, a box of real fruit bits, a box of delicious snacks, a box of eight-treasure porridge, a box of Mengniu, two boxes of breakfast cakes, two bags of Beijing preserved fruits, a bag of apples, how can I say no? What should I do next?"
"Good morning Mengniu, the cereal kefir is delicious! ! Highly recommended~"
Bought for my mother. The call volume is very low. I have adjusted the volume of the phone to the maximum but it still doesn’t work. I am depressed... I want to return it.
The logistics is very fast. I placed the order at night and it arrived at around 10 o'clock the next morning. It took 2 days to turn on the phone. The response is fast and the battery life is great. I can read books and watch movies very well. I am quite satisfied.
"The sound from the receiver is weak. What should I do? Turning up the volume is not enough, especially in the subway or on the bus. It is even harder to hear."
"10,000% bad reviews, damn it! They didn't even put the film on, and there was no service at all."
I like drinking milk from Mengniu brand. I am really happy.
"Just bought it on the third day. It looks average, performs well, and has enough memory. The screen size is moderate and overall it’s good!"
I bought this tablet and decided not to use Huawei products anymore...
"I like it very much, the quality is also beautiful"
Huawei tablets are also good
"This tablet is beautiful, the sound quality is good, the volume is loud, and it is relatively clear. It is a relatively good tablet."
"Support Huawei, support JD.com, Huawei’s quality, JD.com’s express delivery, just now, Lu Bu among men, Red Rabbit among horses, five stars!"
"This time I bought this Huawei mobile phone, and after using it for more than ten days, the phone crashed and could not be turned on."
The pixels are poor and the screen resolution is subpar.
Support Mengniu and Yili! ! !
I have been using it for 2 months. The speed is incredible. The sound quality and screen display are as described. It is a bit wasteful to use for children to do homework. Now it is my entertainment partner. The appearance and experience are as good as I like. willing!
The quality is very good and it’s fast? I really like the speed. It’s really great that it can be so fast on this day of 6.18!
The noise is too great and the pixels are too poor. There is no pixels as high as the rear 1300 and the front 500. The maximum rear 500 is - I am disappointed with Huawei for the first time. I am so disappointed that I will not dare to use Huawei products in the future.
"Very good, cost-effective, I bought it for my mother, it is enough"
"Hmm, not that good, I bought the wrong one"
"Not bad, looks OK, 66666666666666"
Bad review! All you need to buy a mobile phone is the phone and a charger. The most basic protective film case and earphones are not included. Bad review! Bad review! Bad review!
The Jingdong guy worked hard and delivered the goods at almost nine o'clock in the evening. It was still raining heavily. I tried it and the stuff was very good! I’ve never seen anything packaged like this before. There’s no invoice.
"Not good, slow response, unclear screen"
Very smooth and the right size! A very satisfying purchase! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Huawei mobile phones are very good. I have always used Huawei. What is frustrating is that the screen breaks so easily!
"Madam is so disgusting. . Mengniu, go to hell!"
The baby received the package well. The tablet looks beautiful and has fine workmanship. The system runs quickly after booting. The only drawback is that the screen is too mirror-like and has a serious shine. Overall it's good value for money.
"Rubbish, I don’t want to say more. I will never use any Huawei products in the future. They won’t be able to charge within twenty days and the motherboard needs to be replaced. I’m going to be embarrassed."
"Average, the price changes too much, sometimes you can’t buy it, the shopping experience is not good"
It took nine days to deliver the goods from Wuhan to Suizhou. I was really convinced! Never buy anything here again
"The workmanship is good, my wife is using it, and it supports domestic products."
It’s a bit stuck. iQiyi looks too stuck.
"I received the goods, and it was a pity that none of the promises were fulfilled. It was just a bare phone with nothing else, including headphones, high-transparency stickers, and a 10-piece gift package. Decided to return it."
"I received the item quickly. I tried it out and found it to be very smooth. The range of black edges is also acceptable. However, it should be equipped with a protective cover. I’ll buy one online."
"It’s a broken mobile phone. It stopped working for no reason after two months of buying it. I asked customer service and asked 3 questions, and I knew it was bullshit."
"Logistics was too slow, it took several days to arrive. Poor screen, no oleophobic layer, very sticky"
"The workmanship is exquisite. Now I only use the WeChat function and haven’t tried the others. In short, it’s pretty good and of good quality at a low price."
"The quality is very good, the price is right, the price-performance ratio is very high, and it is easy to use. I will buy it from JD.com next time."
"Bought for someone, very satisfied, the screen is clear and tall, perfect,"
"I bought it for a classmate, who said it feels good and the quality is good."
"Because I used Dongjuan and Baitiao, I lost 90. Jingdong didn’t want to sell the phone, so I stopped paying my Baitiao and couldn’t use it. Then the roll was gone, and the phone was out of stock. Jingdong, if you don’t return my Baitiao, I will give you bad reviews until death"
Not good without headphones
"The stuff is very good, genuine, and it heats up quickly."
Counterfeiting is not professional! February 30th! #??# What do you think?
"It’s finally up to you! So happy, so happy! Cute little Mengniu!"
The running speed and memory space are poor. It is recommended not to buy it unless you only use it to browse the web.
"I bought the wrong one, it's too big and can't be held with one hand."
It’s a great deal and I will continue to buy it in the future!
"Very good. Needless to say, the performance is very fast. The delivery is very fast and the service is considerate."
"I feel a little uncomfortable. If I had known earlier, I would have bought Xiaomi."
"The biggest feature of Huawei is that the call quality is good and should be intact. The disadvantage is that the game will crash and there are big black borders, but I am very satisfied."
"Very suitable for children, a perfect purchase..."
I was disappointed with the express delivery. I called and said I was in a hurry and the delivery was postponed until the afternoon! I don’t want to buy anything from JD.com anymore.
"Not great, I returned the used one!"
Very good. I’m very happy to buy it for my family.
I just bought the 128G one today. I really like the slender body shape. I have used it and it has no lag.
"The phone version is a 64G tablet, and the delivery is fast. It looks very good. I will comment more after I use it!"
"Very good, dad likes it very much, but it’s a bit too big! Can’t let it go in summer?"
"Bad review. The charger exploded when charging a mobile phone for the first time. Fortunately, it didn’t catch fire. The quality of Huawei is very doubtful. I only bought it less than two months ago. I hope you can give me an explanation."
"Since last year, I will no longer buy any Mengniu products. It’s so disgusting! Please don’t buy Mengniu anymore from now on @??verta"
"It’s so late that I have time to review it. The tablet looks very good, but the signal is too poor. Even with the mobile card installed, I can’t make calls even if there is no signal. Is this a talking tablet? The worst online purchase I’ve ever made."
"The price drop is too serious, garbage"
"Support domestic production, good configuration and suitable price! The guy from Jingdong is awesome. ."
"First of all, the logistics is very fast and the quality of the tablets is very good. Jingdong is recommended and trustworthy."
"It works fine but there is not enough memory. Where is the promised 16G? Why are there only 4 Gs available? Alas, can current merchants be reliable?"
"Not bad, the workmanship is exquisite, the system is smooth, and it supports domestic products, Huawei, and JD.com."
"The company you dislike the most is Mengniu, don’t you think it’s Mengniu?"
"Tonight, my mother knew that I was in a bad mood, so she went with me to Trust-Mart. I bought a lot of wild food, including my favorite Mengniu fruit milk, and I was able to talk to my mother about my concerns! ! Mom is so kind! !"
I have always liked Huawei's products and have always trusted JD.com's self-operated products.
"It's okay, relatively smooth, and I'm getting familiar with the system."
"The phone should be ready for use, so I can give it five stars. But please explain: when you fill in the address, it shows that the product is available in the area and can be delivered to your door. Why do I have to walk 1 kilometer to town to get the goods after successful payment? !"
"I just want to say, how come the buttons are so loose, as if they have been used for a long time? Can you give me some money to repair or return the goods?"
"The Xiaomi my daughter uses is slow, so I bought this one. It’s pretty good, fast and feels good."
Mengniu is about to be shot again.
"With high-quality nutrition, pure taste and efficient absorption, Mengniu pure milk is your best choice. The homework is completed, the teacher please grade it."
I bought it for a colleague. Huawei is okay. It seems that there are not many suitable phone tablets. I have to choose this one.
"The goods arrived very quickly, and I am very satisfied with it in every aspect. The camera clarity is good and the internet speed is good. I will buy this product next time."
It’s not bad. It’s fast to buy things in JD.com’s self-operated stores.
It has been several days since I received the mobile phone. It is very practical. This is the second time I have bought it. My colleagues thought it was very good and bought one too. I trust JD.com!
"It is said that high-definition video can be played continuously for 11 hours, but the battery runs out after three or four hours. I am not satisfied."
"I haven't received the goods, nor have I received a delivery call or text message. Why does it show that the transaction is completed and I signed for it? Really convinced"
Adding Milo and Mengniu breakfast milk together gives it a weird taste.
The most rubbish tablet ever.
"The stuff is very good, I bought it for the second time"
It’s so naughty. The price was reduced by 100 on the third day. I’m speechless.
"It’s too stuck! Nothing is opened, it just says there is not enough memory. I understand where the 3G of running memory is dead! ! !"
It turns out that Mengniu is also sponsoring it. . . The airport for the air show is so beautiful
"It's not useful at all,"
It’s great. It’s consistent with the description. Installation is also free. 5 points.
"This is an absolutely refurbished phone. The warranty expired for the phone I bought in October is actually May 2017? Can someone help me use this phone? It's stuck. Who knows who uses it, and rubbish JD.com can’t be trusted anymore"
"Still coming? Stop lying and behave like a person. The boycott of Mengniu and the boycott of other industries related to Niu Gensheng can be carried out at the same time and there is no conflict! Reply It seems that Mengniu is fully controlled by COFCO, so it doesn’t matter what happens to Niu Gensheng, right?"
"It was also said that the battery is durable and ran out of power after playing for 4/5 hours, but it took 12 hours to charge!"
Not bad. I bought it for the elderly. They just read the news and watch movies. It is basically enough. The price is cheaper than other e-commerce companies.
"Curry can help you lose weight, so eat more of it, but there is a Mengniu advertisement in the middle, which is not good~"
"The screen is just right, not bad"
"The screen malfunctioned seriously. After buying it for more than half a month, the screen failed to respond many times. At this time, the customer service suggested that I go to an outlet for testing. I didn’t bother yet, but I don’t trust outlets by nature."
The doctor actually bought Mengniu. Should I drink it or not?
It’s just average! The quality of the mobile phone is not very good and it is not easy to use. The mobile phone is very laggy. I hope my friends will not buy this model. It is not practical!
"Authentic, my son likes it very much, great"
"The after-sales service is so bad. It has been two months since the shipment was due, but it hasn’t been shipped yet. I didn’t ask, and they didn’t even give me a message!!!"
Nice board! It fits the hand very well and the configuration is pretty good.
"The phone card tray is easy to install backwards, unlike before"
There is no protection in a broken cardboard box for the tablet computer.
"It's as perfect as I imagined, the operation is smooth, the battery life is long, the display is clear, and the sound quality is good. I am very satisfied."
"I have severe lag while playing the game. Can I return it? The packaging was thrown away, I thought the domestic machine was very useful. The mobile phone is okay, but the tablet is really difficult to use!"
"The screen size is just right, the speed is fast, and it's great for watching movies."
"It works fine, but sometimes it gets stuck suddenly."
"The stuff is pretty good, I will continue to pay attention"
"Very nice tablet. . . It basically meets the needs, and the compatible software is also compatible, unlike Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 which is really difficult to use!"
"No, there are not many things to say as gifts."
"The whole family has always supported domestically produced products, and all use Huawei mobile phones. I just received them and opened them to see that the screen is very clear! It runs very smoothly. Take some time to evaluate again."
"Great Aimeng Cow Sour Yogurt! ! ! ! I especially like the original flavor! Every time I drink it, I feel like the world is so beautiful! ! It used to be Fahrenheit’s endorsement, and I could still see Aaron, but now it’s Han Geng, so depressing!"
The domestic version of Mengniu brand banana milk is also delicious!
It’s not very good. The phone gets very hot after charging for a while and the screen is not flat. I’m too lazy to return it.
"It's bigger than the mini. It's fine for watching videos, browsing the web, reading books, and just playing around. If it's just for playing games, I think the mini is still more fun. After all, the resources are different."
"The delivery was a day late. Apart from this, everything else is fine. The size is just right and not heavy."
"Not good, too bad, not good at all, what the hell!"
"Is it the goods delivered by Express Express, not Jingdong Express? Has Jingdong Express gone bankrupt/"
I haven't received an invoice since the delivery. I have been asked three times and they told me that I am on the way. How many weeks can I go on the road?
"In addition, the mobile phone has started to get stuck and sometimes calls cannot be made. What to do?"
"There are some problems. Huawei music software does not run smoothly. After using it for a few days, I found that the volume keeps changing when listening to music after locking the screen. It is strange that sometimes the Baidu interface will pop up on its own. I am speechless. . . ."
"JD.com described the resolution with a mobile phone card as 1920×1080, but it turned out to be only 1280×800. The extra money was not spent to be able to use the mobile phone card, but just for the resolution of 1080. This is a huge trap."
"Good appearance, relatively good"
"Great value for money and worth reaching out for. The mobile phone is very easy to use, quite good"
"The first picture is from the Huawei I bought before, and the second and third pictures are from the Huawei I bought this time. They are all 4+64G. I can’t tell. I hope I can explain. The customer service always thinks I am making trouble unreasonably. The service attitude is really enough"
Failed to make yogurt. Is it too cold? Let’s buy a can of Mengniu at night.
"It works, everything works fine."
"Good, M3 screen ratio is very good, delicate, Huawei is trustworthy and has craftsmanship. The P10’s photography is so powerful. The last picture was taken by a certain brand. There is a gap."
One word difference
"It’s okay, the packaging is solid, but there’s too much software."
"One star is for express delivery, which is okay. The brand I like does not have a film, and there is a gift after placing an order, but I don’t have one. I am really speechless for you Jingdong..."
"It feels good to use, it’s easy to use, but now I want to buy one with a bigger screen!"
You said that Ding Junhui's playing skills have been average in recent years. Is it because he drank too much Mengniu?
"Don't want to say too much, ugh"
"I bought it for my parents for video use. It’s pretty good in every aspect, but it’s a little laggy when playing games. After all, you get what you pay for. Overall, I’m quite satisfied. However, the packaging is really crude. I guess I can trust my courier."
"After I bought it, I applied for an unlock code on Huawei's official website and it showed that the two codes did not match. I called Huawei customer service and told me that it might be a counterfeit product. I was really sad. I still recommend that you go to the official website to buy these things."
Thank you Mengniu customer service for taking this matter seriously and providing compensation.
Bought this for my mother-in-law. She likes it very much. My wife and I are very happy.
Ping An also likes to drink Mengniu Xiaojian yogurt! @Mengniu micro customer service
It feels good in the hand and the size is just right. There have been no problems so far. Huawei products are trustworthy. Several mobile phones and tablets at home are from Huawei.
"Bad review, JD.com is playing word games, there are gifts for online consultation, after purchasing, you will randomly choose 1 out of 5, bad review, bad review, bad review"
"What is this thing selling? Garbage among garbage, I really don’t know how it got into JD.com, damn it makes me angry just talking about it"
"There is an obvious yellow screen on the upper, lower and right side of the screen. I have applied for a replacement."
"Don’t buy anything from JD.com in the future. The service is terrible. The screen broke within 20 days of purchase. If you contact customer service, they won’t exchange it or give you a refund. Please don’t trust JD.com in the future."
Resolution is not ideal
Not satisfied negative review
"Something went wrong and I returned the LeTV membership card as a gift. Unfortunately, the gift was gone when I returned. What can I say? The screen failed when I received the 5.1. I returned the product and this happened again. There is something wrong with JD.com’s character."
"There are many problems, Mengniu is not optimistic"
"The phone is good, and JD.com is as fast, good, and cost-effective as ever. I hope the price will be more favorable in the future, and I believe there will be better harvests."
Reply I will buy real Mengniu yoghurt next time. Thank you for supporting Mengniu (but this picture...)
The machine consumes a lot of power and charges very slowly. It can take several hours to fully charge.
It’s not very good. The clarity is extremely poor. It started to malfunction after using it for a while. I can’t mute the sound or use the loudest sound. I’m not very satisfied.
"Logistics is really not that good, no door-to-door delivery, allowing users to pick up the goods themselves."
Very good. I just received the product today. I opened it and used it. It is very good. It supports Huawei and is very easy to use.
I can’t believe that the screen is stuck. It’s common for apps to run lag. It takes at least three minutes to open a picture in CAD. Is it a fake?
I only reviewed it after playing it for a few days. It's pretty good and the price is cheap. I bought it for my dad to use in Landlords. Support domestic production
The machine is good and easy to use!
Very good. My father likes it very much.
I bought this for the company. My colleagues said it is very useful and I plan to buy one for my wife too.
"The sound is small, the speaker quality is poor, and it's not durable enough to just turn on a hot spot and not play it for a day. It’s turned off from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.! I really regret it until my intestines turn blue."
"I received the goods today and will be shipped from Shandong to Shanxi in the same day, fast, fast, fast"
"The tablet is okay, the only thing I’m not satisfied with is that it doesn’t come with anything, not even a film."
"I remember that the flash sale was 32G, and the one sent was 16G. ."
"Highly recommended: This milk is really delicious! Well, although it is from Mengniu. However, I gave it a go. It tastes really good!"
"The return key also takes up one line of the screen, which looks very uncomfortable and is poorly designed."
"Will keep buying, great value for money. Will keep buying, great value for money. Will keep buying, great value for money."
"It’s great to play games, and the price is very affordable too."
Love the new packaging of Mengniu pure milk
"Cheap but not good, you know. The worst thing is that there is no flash and the touch screen is unresponsive. This is a stupid Huawei."
"Customer service number 38376, your whole family will die"
"I’ve already bought my second one and it still works great! It’s much cheaper this time, haha"
Mengniu Guanyi Milk enhances immunity @Hu Xijin @??
Calls are often dropped and the signal is unstable
"You will have no face after being born out of the womb, so it’s easy to find someone who has the face. What the hell is that noise made by a shameless thing? Oh my god. Mengniu, you are so shameless! Positive energy? Damn it, you have the nerve to say positive things?"
"I just received the item. I ordered it last night and received it at noon today. Hurry! You have to charge it before using it, use it and see before talking!"
"Very bad. In the current market situation, the price is almost astronomical. The screen display resolution is poor, the screen is small, and the response is not good. I have been fooled."
It’s my favorite type. I placed the order yesterday and it arrived today.
"It's pretty good, very smooth. I really regret buying a brand like LeTV for my mobile phone. Although the configuration is high, the smoothness is far inferior to Huawei."
"What the hell, I’m convinced by JD.com! Rubbish,"
"It feels stuck, moderate, not fast enough, the worst thing, the factor, the sound, the sound quality is so bad"
Our food is messy... I'm considering not eating meat this week. Thank you so much to him and his mother. Thanks also to Yili and Mengniu.
"I bought 18, and 6 of them are broken. It has been half a month, and I was told that professional technicians would take care of it, but there has been no result. When can I get the results?"
"Rubbish store, refurbished machine, bastard, unscrupulous seller"
It’s the first time you’ve been cheated. The customer service has made you lose your temper.
"It’s pretty good. It’s just that after I bought it, there was a sale. I would have bought it later if I had known about it. Overall, it’s a good review."
"Self-operated by JD.com, Huawei's thousand-yuan notebook is cost-effective, supports domestic products, and has excellent logistics. Five points of praise! !"
"Bought for the company, not bad, not bad"
"It looks okay...but there is no screen protector...there is no original screen protector...if you buy a mobile phone, you will get a tempered screen protector as a gift! I am very dissatisfied. Negative review"
"Mengniu, bah!"
"I placed the order last night and it arrived this morning. JD.com is really fast! When I took the photo, it felt very clear! Calling is also good! There is no lag when playing videos! not bad! ! More reviews later! !"
"The king among domestic products, it feels good in the hand, but the screen is a bit small. Why is there no 10.1 version? ?"
"No, sometimes the wifi is disconnected and sometimes crashes?"
"Very good, very satisfied"
The workmanship is pretty good and the sound quality is also very good. I just got it for trial and will review it later. The delivery is fast and the courier is nice.
"Fuck Mengniu, bullshit Deluxe and never buy it again. Many mainland companies may think so. Did Mengniu just accidentally tell the truth? If Mengniu does not die, the will of heaven cannot be tolerated."
"Definitely don’t buy this, it’s too bad, definitely a bad review"
"Quite satisfied in every aspect! I just feel that the response is not as fast as the mobile phone, but it doesn’t matter, I just watched the video."
"Satisfied, support domestic production. Not stuck at all. You are right to choose Huawei. China has a bright future."
"Tablet, just buy an iPad honestly, you can’t afford all kinds of injuries"
It's a good tablet. It doesn't freeze when playing games. The sound quality is stereo. It's a good tablet.
"Why didn't you call when the courier was delivered? Is your mobile phone out of charge? I didn’t even know who signed for it. Later, my family signed for it."
"At this price, the quality is pretty good and the price-performance ratio is quite high. It's a little smaller than expected, but it's enough. The resolution is not very high and the picture is grainy. Overall, very satisfied."
"Very good, the quality is also good, it is genuine"
"The price was reduced by 170 just after I bought it. After contacting JD.com customer service, I applied for a price guarantee. Overall very satisfied. Huawei's stuff is awesome! !"
"When I bought it, I happened to catch up with the 618 event and the price was reduced. Bought at 988, the stuff is really good and easy to use!"
It looks ok and can be used. I bought it for my dad.
"I bought a condom online. Everything about the tablet is good, but I’m used to seeing Apple’s resolution, and suddenly I’m not used to seeing this. It’s worth buying."
"I have quit breastfeeding for a long time, especially Mengniu and Yili. I even stopped eating my favorite pudding ice cream. How can this kind of management be so good?"
"Good, stylish appearance, meets my needs"
"This is the second time I bought this phone and it works great. It’s a new phone, but the gift I was told was not delivered. It’s a word game and I have to leave a negative review."
"As fast as ever, things are easy to use"
"I haven't had any problems with it now, it feels pretty good and it doesn't get stuck."
"The item was received, and the delivery speed was quite fast. I received it on the same day I placed the order in the early morning. Originally, the system showed that it was expected to be delivered tomorrow, but I received it on the same day. It was better than expected. I am very satisfied."
"The stuff is amazing, the workmanship is amazing, and the sound quality is great, but the battery is not that durable! !"
Looks good but the battery is not very powerful
????????????????????????????????????? ???????? !
The stuff is very good and the express delivery is also very fast.
"It says 8g on the box, but it’s actually only 5g, and the pixels are no longer good."
"The color is beautiful, the quality is also very good, value for money, I like it very much."
The color is beautiful. Quality Lean.
"I criticized Air China several times for insisting on sending Mengniu, but unfortunately they didn’t listen to me, haha. Support Lao Luo in promoting service quality in the domestic aviation industry."
It’s quite slow. I recommend buying a Xiaomi tablet.
It’s really good. I’m very surprised in every aspect. I support Huawei and domestic products!
"May 26th*. Only seven days have passed, and the price has depreciated drastically on June 2nd! I feel depressed. Will it be* in a few days?"
"Instant sale, cost-effective, good, trust Huawei, support domestic products, domestic products rise, rise, rise"
Mengniu is an idiot. It’s terrible to be uneducated.
"I was feeling uncomfortable all over, but the sip of white wine my mom gave me really helped. Now I'm so hungry that I drank two boxes of Mengniu in one go. I can sleep well tonight, my work status will be tomorrow..."
Price reduced just after purchase! This is too much! !
"The new machine, which is less than two weeks old, has already bent into a curved surface. I don’t know what to say!"
It's very good to use. The price is much better than Apple's. It supports domestic products. I've been using it for a few days. I can watch TV series for ten hours without any problem. I hope it can be used.
"The processor is fast, the resolution is high, it's smooth, and it feels good"
"The order was placed at 4 a.m. that day and received at 4 p.m. The logistics was so fast! Authentic! It hasn't been turned on yet, but there should be no problem. From now on, I will use Huawei's domestic products!"
It feels fast.
"Very good, good sound effect, fast speed"
"A sad story, only one star"
I am an old customer of Huawei. My aunt's family bought two before. It works fine. So I bought one for my daughter! Looking forward to our next cooperation.
"Huawei's products are indeed good. I strongly support domestic products, especially domestic products with good quality."
"The picture quality is okay, but the sound is a bit low"
"It's a gift, okay."
"I'm speechless. I bought 1488 yesterday and immediately paid 1299 today. I was so happy shopping now and I feel sick to death. Jingdong, why do you ask me to still buy things from you in the future? I got hurt once and that's enough."
"Playing games on the big screen is very comfortable! Everyone’s phones at home have been replaced by Huawei phones, which support domestic products and JD.com"
This monkey was beaten very badly after drinking Mengniu. . Can you tell me if this guy drank Mengniu?
"1. There is no application lock. Customer service asked me to update the software but it failed. 2. The screen cannot be turned off automatically. Sometimes if you forget to operate, the screen will stay on until the battery is exhausted~~~I regret buying this junk~~~~~~~~~~"
I bought it for my mother and installed it with WeChat so I can video chat. It feels very good!
Is there anything good to say about this delivery?
"Let’s not talk about the unclear video and poor quality! I would like to ask how to dual-SIM dual standby? It is obviously a simple SIM card machine, isn’t this a scam?"
"I despise Mengniu, I will advise everyone around me to stay away from it"
The tablet that just arrived today. It is very slow to start up and charge too slowly. It uses up power very quickly. It is an unpacked and used tablet.
# Mengniu’s production date has been tampered with #Don’t drink Mengniu’s~~
"Mengniu, can I not take your class? So boring"
"The delivery speed is slower than a snail, and the customer service is fooling people all day long"
#FriendshipTaste# Yili Mengniu What the hell. http:t.cn/zWpSrn9
"What's going on with the iemi number more than 50 days in advance? The battery is good and the heat is good, but the difference is too big at 50 days. I'll give you a negative review. This is the first negative review in history."
"Affordable, great value for money, good for children"
"The price dropped before I received the goods, then dropped again the next day, and the price was different again on the third day. Then my application for price protection was rejected. The product’s touch screen response is slow"
"The logistics is fast, overall it is cheaper than Huawei Mall, and the color is very clean."
"It doesn't work at all, I feel like I've been cheated."
Huawei's workmanship is indeed extraordinary and a domestic benchmark. I used it for one night to evaluate it. The performance is great and the price is very affordable.
"Bought this for an old lady. After playing with it on a date, she said it was very useful!"
"Why hasn’t Mengniu gone bankrupt yet? The shelf life of 3,000 boxes of Mongolian milk was tampered with http:t.cn/zWEw4Bz Shared from HD retina http:t.cn/aCuxQP"
"I placed the order that morning and received the goods in the afternoon. It was really fast! I have been using Huawei mate7, this m3 has all the same functions, and it is very fast when I first use it. Answer the phone only by hands-free"
The machine performs very well and the logistics is fast
"Bad reviews, nothing."
"Today, I was sitting next to a man on the plane. I heard on the phone that he was from Siemens and that he was enjoying himself while drinking Mengniu yogurt..."
"Bad review, no protective case, 5-star bad review!"
"I bought my second one, I really like it!"
"If I could give it zero stars, I would definitely give it zero stars. The memory is only 2.7G, which is much different from 3G. The internal storage is only over 24G, which is much different from the labeled 32G. Can Huawei be more honest?"
"I checked it carefully. The quality of the product is really good, and it is also very high-end. The key is that it is of high quality and low price, great value for money, and good service. I like it."
I like Mengniu
"I would like to ask, is this how your maintenance department treats customers' products? If I had known earlier, I might as well have taken it to a local repair shop for repair!"
"Have a wonderful time reading, accompanied by Mengniu Youyiyi C"
"I like Mengniu walnut milk ~ I have to buy it, it’s the only one I like besides yogurt."
"Very easy to use, 5 stars!"
Very good. The logistics speed is super fast. My son likes it very much. I give it full marks and support JD.com.
It seems that you have been accustomed to this nickname for a long time... Mengniu is so powerful...
Laugh it off #??share# Mengniu changed its advertising slogan for the first time in 13 years and made a mistake? Mengniu changed its advertising slogan for the first time in 13 years and made a mistake? --- http:t.cn/zl07cJu
"I only reviewed it after using it for a few days. It’s a good product, cost-effective, affordable, and the picture and sound are clear. It’s worth buying!"
"Not bad, it runs fairly smoothly, but the screen is a bit insensitive"
"Huawei's machine is very good, the price is reasonable, the speed is fast, and there is no lag at all."
It’s pretty good. I’ll probably buy it again once I get used to it.
Mengniu bastard!
The order placed after 10pm was received the next morning! ! ! What a speed. Large cell phone?
"One star is for JD.com. After the purchase, the price was reduced, applying for price insurance was very troublesome, and I found various reasons not to return the money."
"There was a problem with taking photos at the beginning, and it was quickly solved before the year. I have to say that the quality is average, but JD.com’s service is excellent."
"Reject Mengniu! Mengniu is not a ""cow"", it is a ""tumor"". Shameless and unscrupulous. Apologize and apologize. Keep shouting every day. Be responsible for the health of your customers, cherish life and stay away from Mengniu @Friends of Walmart"
Mengniu Guanyi milk is delicious. I am at: http:t.cn/zjvN4Md
"NND, I tell you for the last time not to drink Mengniu! Black-hearted companies always have no consciencet.cn/"
Mengniu? . Progress is so sad
"Bought for my parents, very satisfied."
"Fighter among garbage, who knows who uses it, screen garbage, system garbage, etc."
This phone is too sluggish and stuck all the time. I really regret it.
"It’s not bad, and it’s good to use. . The price is right"
"There is not everything in the box, including the standard headphones. It’s too bad and disappointing."
"The response is very fast. You can make calls without headphones, and the screen reflection can be used as a mirror."
It supports domestic products and is good to use.
"Mengniu #Just for a little bit of happiness# You focus on every bit of happiness, and we are focusing on every bit of you - just for a bit of happiness http:t.cn/hDoPt1 Mengniu Mengniu, the cow of the Chinese people!"
"My parents started to learn how to surf the Internet together, and they said it works well."
"It feels okay, pretty smooth."
"Isn't it okay to give me a leather case? The logistics is very fast, and I don’t know if the mobile phone is easy to use."
Thank you Fang Fei and Mengniu for helping us take photos and giving me the opportunity to be on camera!
"After the goods arrived today, I immediately went to the store to apply the film, but when the waiter wiped the screen, he said there were scratches and he scratched his hands. I didn’t expect this to happen, so frustrating! ! !"
"What a big mobile phone, suitable for the elderly"
Mengniu is awesome
Is it weird? All like this. . . Mengniu has even less...
"After using it for a month, it won't turn on, which is frustrating. Evaluations still require a label, and the label options are all good. Why is JD.com like this?"
"The charging port has obvious old signs of being plugged and unplugged. I don’t know why JD.com sent a used machine. I am also a Jindiaan user. This is my first time! This time I bought it for a colleague, I can’t say anything! ! !"
It's so bad that you still dare to sell GUG junk stuff. The housekeeper can't even brush it off.
What are you playing! Why don't you just put some foam in the box? It's just hanging around like this. I get angry when I see this packaging. What the hell?
"The new milk from Mengniu is beautiful and too expensive, but it tastes good!"
Will you die if you drink Mengniu... I'm so upset.
Have a box of Mengniu before going to bed and sleep until dawn~
It's quite good. I mainly use it to read the pdf first. I recommend everyone to buy it!
"Food accountability is too light. Mengniu should have gone bankrupt long ago. ""Nine negative incidents that have been exposed at Mengniu in the past four years"" http:t.cn/zWEEJOZ (shared from @???)"
"Very good, easy to use! ! ! !"
"It seems to be produced by Ganzhou Mengniu Branch. This makes me, the poor people in Ganzhou, who cannot afford to drink milk from abroad, feel so embarrassed. . It seems that Meng Milk no longer dares to drink. . So great. Repost on Weibo"
I bought it for an elderly person in my family. I tried it for a few days and it works very well.
Pretty perfect. Good stuff.
The arrival was very fast. I placed the order in the afternoon and it was delivered the next morning. The machine is genuine and I played the Halong Valley mobile game smoothly without any lag.
"The configuration is good, the sound quality is particularly good, and the battery life is also satisfactory."
How many foreigners have no time to worry about Mengniu’s advertising slogan? They treat consumers as fools and watch Mengniu perform a one-man show!
"The items haven't arrived yet, but you confirmed receipt for me yesterday? ? ? ? ? ? What tricks is JD.com doing?"
"Yes, the price/performance ratio is quite high. The child keeps watching without getting stuck or burning. I just bought less, so I had no choice but to place another order!"
Jingdong’s self-operated product is Niu. The photo I took at around 10pm arrived the next morning. It’s very smooth to use.
"The thing looks like it should be genuine, but it is not as advertised. The battery is not durable. After playing mobile games for a while, the battery runs out. I don’t know if it is a problem with the new version or with the mobile phone. I do not recommend buying it!"
The resolution is too low and the pixels are too poor to match the description.
"Is this grape skin? Facts have proved: Mengniu has no limit to cheating people, and its quality will always be inferior!"
Is Huawei starting to bully customers in its stores?
Just used it. It’s a bit small and super slow. It took a full ten days to arrive.
"Is it possible to buy a mobile phone without headphones? Bad review, bad review,,,"
"Bought for dad, economical and affordable"
"I made a pizza, it was really a pizza... I only had Mengniu to eat it once in a while. I eat it with soy milk every day when I get up. It has the flavor of combining Chinese and Western styles, and also makes me question my involvement in the world of Western cuisine."
"It was my first time to buy a tablet, and I chose the domestic one. After using it, it was very easy to use and I was not disappointed. The domestic one was really good! ! !"
"I didn’t say anything. I was really dissatisfied. When I got my phone repaired, I spent another fifty yuan on it."
"Jingdong is rubbish, the price is reduced right after purchase, and no compensation is given"
"The tablet is beautiful and high-end, mainly because it is smooth to use and responds quickly without lag!"
Yili’s is not as delicious as Mengniu’s! The original flavor is better than the strawberry one! I bought the last two rows of Mengniu products.
"It's pretty good, but the price dropped just a few days after I bought it, which makes me very sad. But the tablet is really good, easy to use, and has good reviews."
Pretty cool!
"Advantages: Cheap, big, and pretty. Disadvantages: Low resolution. Equivalent to Nokia 7610 ten years ago. Screen effect is very grainy. Standby time: half a day. Charging is very slow. 0-100 7 hours."
"Bad reviews, bad reviews, bad reviews, the button broke not long after I bought it."
A Mengniu manager was caught tampering with the production date
The Mengniu Hottest Newcomer Ceremony was very shocking. Looking forward to exo. I am at: http:t.cn/zl7Xr4E
Mengniu Yili was blacklisted by me a long time ago. I won’t touch a drop of it from now on. How dare I drink it @???
"While boycotting Japanese goods, let’s boycott Mengniu together!"
"Less than a month later, the WIFI is not working! I have never used such a bad cell phone!"
"The best of rubbish. The call quality is not good and the call is disconnected frequently. It hangs up automatically at every turn. Sometimes there is no sound. I don’t know if I can’t even solve this problem, what’s the use of this phone?"
The use experience is relatively smooth. The dual 4G version with data card can meet most needs and can also be used as mobile WiFi. It is a new choice for the main wingman.
I reduced the price by * Yuan within 2 days of delivery! ! ! ! Get your money back! ! ! !
"Domestic high-quality product, very easy to use, first-class workmanship, and feels very good when used."
"The last time I bought a tablet, it didn’t have a phone function. This time, 618 Jingdong was doing a promotion and I bought an m3 tablet with a phone function. The quality is first-rate and the workmanship is pretty good. It just doesn’t have a handset. Self-operated delivery. Order in the morning. Place an order in the afternoon. arrive,"
The voice is noisy and uncomfortable. .
"It is very smooth to use, the screen is clear, and it can be installed on all China Unicom, China Mobile, and China Telecom. It is trustworthy and worthy of sharing."
"The price was reduced right after I bought it, and there was no price guarantee. I was angry!"
I have been using Huawei from m2 to m3 and it is very good to support the new model of Huawei m3.
"# Mengniu Variety Big Show# After the change, the outer packaging of Mengniu pure milk is very fresh, but I still like the 81 bags of 6+1 breakfast milk the most, which is a civilian enjoyment."
This is the first time I use JD.com to purchase. Such service attitude and delivery speed. I can only say that I have uninstalled it. Haha.
It works well. The pesticides are not stuck at all. The battery is very useful. I can play with it for two days on a single charge.
"It was my first time to buy something on JD.com, and the quality was super bad. The touch screen broke after less than half a month of use."
"Improper sales techniques, pre-sales, deposits, and IOUs were not properly arranged. I don’t know if I will visit again in the future. It is recommended that you be careful. ."
Huawei's quality is still unsatisfactory. Domestic fighter jets
I will never give Jingdou five-star reviews every time in the future. The delivery logistics is too rubbish.
"The phone is broken. I asked for an exchange, but no one accepted it."
It's a piece of junk. It crashes before you can use it and can't be turned on. Don't be fooled.
It’s quite smooth to use. Huawei is doing a good job now.
"Not bad, I bought several"
"Good, good, good, very good for a long time. don't know what i'm doing"
"I am really doubtful about the product, what quality! The speaker of the new mobile phone I bought is broken"
"The tablet screen of Huawei Honor 7 is very blurry, the resolution is too low, and the running speed is slow. Because it uses the lowest-end Spreadtrum solution, I regret buying this one."
Huawei is a big brand and trustworthy. All my mobile phones are from Huawei. The tablet screen is bigger than I expected and the images are very clear. It should be enough for the elderly. I will use it for a few days and I will review it if it is good.
I just use it to watch videos. It’s similar to a mobile phone and doesn’t feel like anything.
"The logistics is fast, but the downloading of the game is too slow."
"I originally thought that the packaging change was good, but after I found someone to apply the film, I discovered that there was a hole in the film. Now I feel like there is a hole in the film, and I feel like there is a fly in it. It is very uncomfortable. What a helpless shopping experience -_-| |"
"The quality is quite good, it should be genuine and it is guaranteed. The third installment of Baitiao is interest-free and it runs very smoothly."
"Overall, it’s pretty good. Huawei’s quality is trustworthy."
Beautiful Huawei! With support! The response speed is very fast.
Things are okay and convenient to use
"No headphones either! No hardware is included! Bad, bad, bad!"
"The baby has been using it for a few days and it is very good. It can also make calls and is excellent in all aspects. Worth having, like!"
"The system freezes as soon as I use it. When I click on something, there are two black bars on the top and bottom. I have to restart to solve it. It happened 4 times."
I bought it for the elderly. It is genuine. I like it very much. I trust and support Huawei!
"It’s not ideal as I always open web pages I don’t want to open, but it’s still pretty cheap!"
I don’t like it very much. I bought it without a protective film and it charges very slowly.
"I have purchased electrical appliances on JD.com so many times, but this time I was shocked. I actually bought a refurbished machine from a direct-operated store. There are several alarm clocks set inside. Do new phones have this? It is safer to go to a physical store to buy."
I've been using it for a while and it feels pretty good.
"Not bad, very durable, low price, high performance"
"They said there was a gift, but it turned out there was nothing. It was a lie, and I was speechless."
"The delivery speed is really fast. The order I placed yesterday arrived today. I haven’t used the machine yet so I won’t comment yet, but all my phones are Huawei! So choose Huawei."
Seller has very bad attitude
"It’s too dark, punish the murderer severely! The mastermind behind the scenes: Mengniu! My day! ! ! Repost Weibo"
"The stuff is very good, I like it very much. The delivery is also very fast. I bought it yesterday and it was delivered today."
It works well and the price is reasonable
I just bought it and the price was reduced the next day. No one answered me when I called customer service.
"Knowing that prices will be reduced on 6.18, price protection is useless. Unreasonable bad review! !"
This point is for express delivery! I bought this for my dad. It can be said that it is only suitable for the elderly! The screen is not clear and the pixels are terrible!
"The latest version of Huawei Tablet M3, emui5.0, and Huawei Tablet M3 Youth Edition are both emui5.1. I can’t understand it. Flagship tablets are ignored..."
"Anyway, there was a problem with the speaker within a month, so it had to be repaired. What I should do during the maintenance period is a question I have to think about."
Mengniu is with you for every bit of happiness in ordinary life.
"Just used it, no problems"
"Huawei is good, cost-effective, I like it very much"
"The clarity is poor, the things sent are useless, and the problem is not considered from the customer's perspective."
The junk goods sold by JD.com make me catch up
"It’s not good at all. I used it fast at first, but then it was very slow. I was always waiting to watch TV, and I would turn off the phone from time to time."
I'm still trying it out and haven't found any problems yet. It's a good product at this price.
"The word ""scum"" is below. There is a picture I posted. Click on it to see the comments."
"Damn it, Mengniu’s production line is crazy. I really don’t dare to drink anymore. Repost on Weibo."
"It’s rubbish. When I play the Honor of Kings card, the screen doesn’t work. The built-in browser is broken and I can’t delete it even if I want to. I thought it would be fine if it was well configured, but I didn’t expect it to be so ineffective."
"#CCTVFinanceNationalDaySpecial# Mengniu cheese was exposed to illegal additions of milk mineral salts. The ""milk mineral salts"" controversy continues to spread. Mengniu Children's Growth Cheese was exposed to illegal additions... http:t.cn/zlIDnOi"
"The screen is not clear, the pixels are too watery, and the photo effects are also watery, which is quite poor. It is incomparable with the pixels of mobile phones with the same performance and price. I hope Huawei can produce competitive products and continue to support Huawei..."
A Father's Day gift for my dad. The sound and colors of this tablet are amazing. It's more cost-effective than the iPad mini4.
"Huawei tablet is not bad. Although it seems that the memory is a bit small now, it is ok and it feels good now. This tablet supports OTG function and can be connected to a USB flash drive through an OTG cable, which is beneficial for data exchange."
The running speed is relatively smooth and the operation is easy to get started.
"Something went wrong less than a month after I bought it. They keep talking about supporting domestic products. If you want us to support domestic products, you have to pass the quality of domestic products. No wonder they are buying foreign products."
"The tablet's fine workmanship is worthy of being a big brand. I have been using Huawei's products. The metal body is thin and light, and it feels good to hold. Watching videos is smooth and clear. The system is EMUI5.1 and runs very smoothly. It is a very cost-effective product."
"It looks pretty good, and the sound effects are pretty good!"
Slowly slowly very
"The charging jack has poor contact. When I asked customer service, no one cared about it. Their attitude was bad."
"It came off within a day of wearing it. Jingdong couldn’t believe it either. Too bad,"
The product quality is good and the delivery is timely.
How to say it? The data cable I just received was defective. I called customer service and they asked me to contact after-sales service. Then after-sales service asked me to contact customer service... I went back and forth several times before I got a new data cable.
"The resolution is very poor and there are too many messy built-in software. To uninstall it, you need ROM. This is a death-defying rhythm."
Delivery garbage!
"Atmospheric, easy to use, good!"
Mengniu’s breakfast milk + honey is indeed too sweet. . . I feel nauseated after eating. . .
It's okay to use and the price-performance ratio is okay. The delivery is just too slow.
It’s only 2 days old and it’s so cheap
"It’s not nonsense, it’s really good. It’s easier to use than my original IPAD. It’s easy to download the app and it’s easy to read books. I like it."
"It’s so stuck. Although the price is low, it’s not so stuck!"
Advise Mengniu to change careers! Still eating Mengniu these days is asking for death. I haven’t eaten Mengniu for a long time and I gave up on Mengniu long ago! resist!
I received the baby and have been using it for a day. It is very useful. The quality is also very good and very convenient.
Good reviews
Only by occasionally comparing can we see the difference. This is also the direction of our efforts. I hope that domestic products will get better and better.
"No protective film included, you need to buy it yourself, the effect is not yet known"
The water heater is okay. I just installed it at home. I was too busy at work and didn’t buy an appliance online. It’s great!
The service is very good. The goods arrived today. The service staff came to install it quickly. Very good.
"Received it this morning, very good value for money! Support Huawei!"
"It’s only been a month since I bought it and it was reduced by * yuan. Is there anyone doing this business? I originally wanted to buy a Huawei, you bastard."
I regret buying it. You’d better not buy it. You’ll regret buying it. It’s not easy to use at all.
There are too few things that make people feel at ease now. Is Mengniu really bad? I bought it yesterday. It wasn’t hot on the road this morning. We got home at ten o’clock. @???
"The phone is too laggy. If you want to play a game, don’t use it."
"In addition to Mengniu milk, there is also incredibly terrible Chinese food"
"It's ok, it remains to be seen how the quality is."
Very bad experience.
"If you have any questions, please ask Jingdong customer service. Can you please contact JD customer service directly? What do you want?"
"Very dissatisfied, I can’t play large games at all"
Repeat Mengniu’s mistake
It gets stuck after a while.
"The size is so big, it feels almost the same as an iPad mini, but it’s still easy to use."
"Not satisfied. It was okay at the beginning. After only a few days of use, it was really useless and stuck."
"Not bad. I wanted to buy a tablet, but ended up buying a big mobile phone. However, it’s really good and looks like a rich man. I’m satisfied!"
"The quality is very good, the memory is also good, and it supports domestic products."
"After using it for a while, it feels pretty good and smooth."
I only bought it 3 days ago and the price was reduced. What a scam!
"Compared with the price, the performance of this machine can only be said to be quite satisfactory."
"When I bought the film, I saw a scratch on the screen, but it didn't affect the use. It will take a long time to return or exchange, so I'll just make do with it."
"Not bad, delivery is super fast"
The powerful Mengniu is laughing~ Retweeted on Weibo
"This feels a bit slanderous to Mengniu, so be careful of causing official trouble, haha. ."
"Mengniu is sold to COFCO, will the country advance and the people retreat? sad"
"They all envy the size of my mobile phone, haha, it’s really big"
I bought a phone that loses power very quickly and has problems.
"I received the item, but why can’t I connect to WIFF? Can anyone answer me?"
I bought it less than a month ago and the price was reduced by 100 yuan. . . 12.5 percent price reduction. . . Bad review
"We agreed not to touch Mengniu, Yili and Guangming from now on, but today I bought 1 and got 1 free on Mengniu in the supermarket. My mother couldn't hold it back, and my psychological defense was broken. I felt guilty, and I was very disappointed with myself."
Well enough. . . . . . . . . .
"#??whisler# ""Fried liver, fried tripe, enema, fried noodles, pea yellow..."" In fact, you don't have to work so hard every day to improve your gastrointestinal tract. All you need is a bottle of Mengniu probiotics..."
I wonder if she likes Mengniu or Yili? Maybe prefer sour yogurt?
Very good mobile phone. I have been using Huawei for 3 years. It is very good.
"When it arrived, I checked that the CPU was Qualcomm 615. It was slow to respond and not as good as the online reviews said, so I’ll just use it!"
"The stuff is good, quite satisfied! ! ! Awesome at playing games, especially those speakers."
"Mengniu live bacteria lactic acid likes the smell of aloe vera, and children who like to drink it raise their hands."
"The baby is very good, I use it very well, it is brand new, the packaging is also very good, the delivery speed is very fast, it arrived in less than 24 hours, thank you Jingdong! I got a leather case,"
The four corners of the protective case that came with it are all cracked. It has only been used for about a month. You can see for yourself.
"This star is for customer service. I really don’t want to talk about the phone, but luckily I returned it."
"The sound quality is good, I’ve only reviewed it after buying it for a long time. Support domestic products!"
"Mengniu Youyi c, intestinal activity is always young @ Popular Weibo Mengniu Youyi c1"
"The tablet is not bad, the screen is clear, I have used it for more than ten days and it feels good, and the logistics is very fast."
I chose the package and only received a bare metal unit. I was deceived. Please be careful when buying.
"The quality of Huawei tablets is very good, the Internet speed is very fast, the screen is clear and the touch screen is as sensitive as Apple computers."
"Great color, great sound quality"
Very good baby ~ JD.com has fast delivery and good service ~ Like it? Like it
"Not bad, fast and easy to use"
Poor in all aspects.
The system is smooth! The call is clear! Beautiful model! everything is fine
The machine is defective and I have nothing to say about JD.com
"The product is good and cost-effective, but it doesn’t come with a leather case, which is a bit disappointing."
"My dad's phone just blue screened when I started it up, and then it turned back on again, which was a bit convenient."
"I drink it every day. I haven’t drank Mengniu for many years, and I will never trust Mengniu again."
"On the first day of use, I dropped it from a height of 50cm and half of the screen was broken. This quality is awesome"
The logistics is very slow and the attitude is very bad. I suggest you not to buy it.
"It is said that the Tibetan antelopes in Hoh Xil only drink milk from Yili and not from Mengniu~~~Mengniu, don’t you think you are miserable? Wow hahahahaha @---ning---"
The system is very user-friendly.
"Good, I like the price."
"Mengniu is trying to harm children, while Jiuguijiu is trying to crack down on corrupt officials!"
"The back is gilt, high-end and classy, ??the front is ceramic white, low-key luxury and connotation!"
"I don’t like Huawei, and I’m disappointed when I bought it this time. It’s too bragging."
"The tablet is very good, and this time I bought it at a very good discount. It’s a great deal."
"Why did I buy it like this? The anti-counterfeiting mark has been torn off. I don’t know if it is genuine or if it has been tampered with. Also, there was a free gift as promised, but there was nothing."
too slow
Really good
"Not bad, I bought it for my son."
"The first time I received a bad one, the price was reduced on the way back. I still didn’t ask for the price difference. It was a very unpleasant purchase."
"The resolution is too low and the text is too blurry. It's so bad, I unpacked it and don't know if I can return it, I just can't stand it. More than a thousand wasted. The video is also very blurry."
"Card, pixel difference."
"I have been using it for a long time. To put it bluntly, it is a large phone, but it is really convenient and the size is just right. For daily play, the configuration and size are sufficient."
"It supports WiFi. The camera is not very clear. In use, the price is almost worth it. No problems have been found yet."
"Huawei Honor Tablet is good, easy to use, cheap, cost-effective, and has good service attitude"
I don’t understand why people still buy Mengniu =_= People who are still selling Mengniu can only say that they are looking for death.
"I don’t drink Mengniu, eat cut cakes, buy domestic milk powder, watch Xinwen Lianbo, or take the Hangzhou subway. . . These are the few survival principles that I must adhere to Mengniu"
"The pixels of the front camera are not clear enough, and there will be various black spots in the photos taken. I asked the customer service staff and they said it was not a quality problem."
"Speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless"
"Very, very good. Delivery is good."
"It’s okay, good quality and low price, worth buying!"
"I bought it for my daughter to do homework with, the speakers are pretty good. Like the resolution."
"Good reviews, worth buying."
"Give it to the elderly for use, very useful"
"Not bad, for the elderly"
Mengniu's new packaging changes the soup but not the medicine... I don't want kidney stones or stomach cancer... cherish yourself and stay away from Mengniu!
"I will buy Huawei mobile phones from now on, other mobile phones are almost useless!"
"It’s not good. They don’t even give you cashback for good reviews. Other stores also give you protective cases, headphones, etc., and you don’t even get a paper invoice for the tablet you bought."
I bought it for a friend and used it for children to play games. The response was pretty good.
"The express delivery was supposed to arrive yesterday, but it arrived today. When it arrived, there was an address but they didn’t deliver it or call me. I ordered and received it myself. Put it somewhere else. If I don’t make a call, I probably won’t be able to receive it in my life."
Mengniu pure milk has new packaging. Please support it.
I bought it with my nephew and the feedback was good. It is of high quality and low price. I took the photo at night and it arrived at noon the next day. It is really beautiful and easy to use.
Bought it at 1766. Low profile. The response is really fast when using it. No problem found so far. Support domestic products!
"I trust JD.com. I placed the order in the morning and received it in the afternoon. The packaging was in good condition. The size is suitable, and it feels good to hold it. It opens various software quickly. I like it very much."
"Yes, great value for money"
"It just so happens that we all have them, so let’s take a photo. Mengniu has been walking on the road of pushing the waves behind the copycats and constantly learning~ It’s delicious."
"Rubbish Jingdong, rubbish"
"Express delivery is too slow and file downloading is too slow, making it difficult to use."
"We all drink it, Guangming, Mengniu, Yili... our son also drinks it"
"Ha ha! Mengniu, be careful to become the best laxative."
"Introducing you to drink Mengniu Youyi C, aloe vera flavor is my favorite, but many people like the original flavor, you can try it,"
"not good. It got stuck after just a few days of use! Even restoring factory settings won’t work! I thought Huawei was good! In fact, it’s really not that good ~ I’ll never buy Huawei again. I’m sad."
"The quality is trustworthy, the configuration is good, and it is easy for people aged 30-40 to use it. The phone is stylish and fast ~ Like it like it"
"The logistics is fast, the memory usage is large, and the battery is average, but overall I am satisfied."
COFCO should forget it and just produce products like Mengniu. It’s not good for the future of mankind.
Not very easy to use
"After the 7-day return period, you cannot return the product, and you have to send it to a pick-up point for repairs, which feels very bad."
It’s still worth having!
"Mengniu, really awesome"
"I have received a carton of Mengniu milk. I am very grateful to the director. I know that I am a carnivore, but I don’t understand what the Ri Ri Xu Xin on the postcard means."
Strong concern and strong condemnation. Mengniu is a piece of shit. I will never drink a drop of Mengniu milk in my life!
"The memory card in the discounted set does not come with a matching card. The tablet can only accept micro SD cards. The set is a large card, which is generally used in cameras."
Things are good
"Bad review! , the screen is seriously malfunctioning, and no one cares about it"
I got infected with the virus after using it for more than 10 days.
The best tablet ever.
"It's like an enlarged mobile phone, the speed is still OK, it is mainly used to watch cartoons for children, the playback speed is OK"
"I haven't used it yet. I don't know what to do. The price was reduced within a few hours after purchasing it, and there is no guarantee on the price? sad"
"The first time I used Huawei, I mainly trusted JD.com."
I stopped drinking it a long time ago. Cherish your life and stay away from Mengniu!
"Not bad, but the packaging was torn when it was delivered, and the screen ratio looked a bit uncomfortable. The battery life is very satisfactory!"
Very good. I looked at it for a long time before placing an order.
"This is my first time using the Huawei brand, and I think it’s okay. After all, the price is there. I don’t know how it will fare after using it for a long time. It is still very smooth so far. The fingerprint recognition is also very sensitive and the sound is loud."
"Use it for the elderly to watch movies, affordable and easy to use! ! !"
"Jingdong Logistics is impeccable, as fast as the wind, convenient and fast, and you can get Huawei tablets, excellent workmanship, high quality and low price, support domestic products, support Huawei!"
Dismantled by others. The mobile phone seal is no longer the original one. There are fingerprints all over the screen.
Baby is good. I’ll come next time.
"Alas, it works fine, but the power bank I received cannot be charged. I kept telling customer service that they still haven’t gotten back to me, which is very annoying."
I used #?checkQR code to compare prices# and found that the price of the Mengniu walnut milk (Baili Bao) 200ml/pack I bought was accurate.
"Jingdong's after-sales service is very poor, customer service is slow to respond, and it is difficult to exchange goods."
"Double Eleven is a bit deceptive, the price is 999, and Huawei Mall also gives away mobile phone cases and films. JD.com collected the advance payment in advance and cannot refund it. It feels a bit like being bullied and kidnapped. The experience is very bad."
"It's like buying a big flat phone, but the battery is not durable"
The quality is good. Just like I imagined. A satisfying purchase.
Bought for the elderly to pass the time and watch videos!
"I've been using it for a week and I feel very satisfied! I haven’t found any shortcomings yet! Usually, the kids study, watch TV and so on! enough"
"The order was placed on the 19th and the product arrived on the 20th. After eight days of use, the system encountered a problem. When I took it to Huawei after-sales service, it was found that the motherboard was moldy and the motherboard was repaired privately! Damn, that’s awesome. Be careful. If you don’t go through the warranty recommendations, go check it out. It’s such a scam."
"The tablet is good, fast, and the system is well optimized by Huawei. If I don’t buy a phone call, I just use my phone as a hotspot and use Universal Wife to hack the Internet, which is pretty good."
"The sound effect is good, my parents like it very much, and it is also good to use."
"Huawei is so fucking disgusting, it’s not as good as a mobile phone. . . After doing a little better in the past two years, I started to do it to death. The CPU memory is second-hand, and it is stuck even when playing Plants vs. Zombies. . . I think this IQ tax is ***d"
I just received the goods. I heard it works very well. Now I can turn it on and try to see if it is true.
"I bought an M2 before and it worked well, but I was disgusted by the black borders. After the launch of the M3, I did not hesitate and made a decisive move, finally reducing a lot of the black borders. The M3 looks as big as the M2, but the screen is super delicate. I believe in Huawei's quality and support domestic production. ."
I can only say that it is average
Not good! ! ! Too lazy to say anything
"I bought it from 618, which is quite cost-effective. I bought it for my mother to watch and follow dramas. It can be used by the elderly. The mobile phone is also Huawei. The operation is the same. It is very simple. It is very enjoyable to watch TV."
"Not bad, very good! ! ! ! Worth recommending!"
"I don’t know why, the camera pixels are not clear, and the voice during the call is also very low!"
"I was not satisfied with my purchase. I bought 1588 today and got headphones for 1399 tomorrow. Although the customer service compensated for the difference, I still feel unhappy!"
"Just bought it yesterday, the price is reduced today! Seriously deceiving consumers! The most important thing is that the product is damaged and the phone is defective! ! !"
"I replaced it twice and the battery still drained too fast, so I just returned it."
"The newly purchased charger doesn't work, so I have to return it for maintenance, and I have to go to town to send express. It's so troublesome, a bad review!"
"Great, great sound effects. . . . ."
"One star is for price reduction, the price protection is only 7 days, and the price reduction 10 days after purchase is extremely unpleasant!"
"My tablet keeps crashing, I don’t know why? I am very disappointed with JD.com this time."
"Although it is not the latest tablet, the performance is still good, easy to use, cheap and cost-effective"
"If you buy it, the price will be reduced. Junk Jingdong"
"It works all over the Internet, but I’m missing a charger. No one answered me when I left a message at customer service. Definitely give a bad review. ."
A big domestic brand! Trustworthy! Jingdong fast delivery
"It’s really not good. The resolution is horribly low and the screen is super blurry. If I had known this price, I would have spent more money to buy an Apple. It’s not worth it. Remember this lesson. Never shop randomly on JD.com again"
The battery is not durable and the rear camera is mounted at an angle
Complain @Mengniu
"First of all, not to mention anything else, as soon as I bought it, I found that the volume and key were broken. Unfortunately, I trust Huawei too much. I didn’t notice it at that time, so I had already thrown away the packaging, otherwise I would definitely return the product."
"It feels a little small, but otherwise there's nothing wrong with it"
"My mother likes it very much. It is ultra-thin, lightweight, has clear viewing screen, and is very cost-effective."
"It looks pretty good, I just tried it. The response was quite fast and the logistics was great. A nice purchase."
Placed order in the morning and received it in the afternoon! quick! very good! Huawei is great!
"The one I purchased at the time said it came with freebies, but MD didn’t have any at all, so I’ve been putting up with it until now."
"Very good, clear, but worried about slowness. I bought a 4G one, but there is still a delay in opening programs. In terms of use, it is almost as expected."
Very useful! Very cost-effective! Support Huawei!
"The attitude of customer service and the customer service of the flagship store is so bad. If there is a problem, they just kick the ball and say they are not the ones to contact. I will definitely leave a negative review."
"Fast response, supports domestic brands"
"It's very heavy, the sound quality is not good, it just has a charger and nothing else. I'm really not very satisfied with this thing, and the customer service attitude is extremely poor. . . . You still have to be careful when buying."
What the hell? The battery is not durable at all. I’m so disappointed.
"Huawei's is very useful, I like it very much. Bought for my wife to use."
"When I placed the order, I was told there was a gift, but when I shipped it, there was nothing. JD.com is shameless."
"The Great Wall has always been like this, the worst among the worst. I really don’t know why people still drink Mengniu?"
"No problem has been found with the host machine, but the quality of the supporting products is too low. It has never been dropped or touched for half a month, and the four corners of the plastic protective cover suddenly cracked and fell off! !"
"He said: Brother Niu is also very happy, Mengniu is doing a good job and supporting national enterprises."
My daughter's tablet has arrived and it looks very good. It supports domestic products.
Don’t buy fakes
"Very good stuff, a little effortless for the elderly?"
"It really feels like there is something wrong with the machine. Downloading things is super slow, and making video calls is several beats too slow. It's quite different from the physical store. I don't know if it's a repair machine."
"I bought it for watching videos and learning, it’s pretty good."
It’s okay. Logistics is fast.
The baby has been received. The packaging is very beautiful and the machine runs very fast. I plan to buy another one for my niece.
"The delivery is fast, but the protection is very poor. You should learn from some e-commerce boxes and put air cushions inside them. Fortunately, only the plastic of the packaging box is damaged."
The mobile phone is good and the express delivery is better. I will buy from this store again in the future.
The quality is so bad. I bought it on July 12th and it broke on September 10th. I can’t receive the wireless network. It’s being repaired now. I’m depressed.
"Very good, the screen is big, but the camera recognition rate is not high, and I don’t take pictures anyway. It is enough for my mother-in-law to watch TV."
"Very easy to put in your baby, affordable, genuine"
"The courier was very enthusiastic, but there was no manual for this tablet."
"It arrived quickly and it works well. For portability, I would have bought one with a bigger screen."
I no longer drink Mengniu. Shouldn't they also help us supervise Yili?
"The product is very good, but the only dissatisfaction is with the eighth clause of the warranty: if the back sticker is torn off or the back sticker is blurred, it is not covered by the warranty. I guess there are not many people who don’t peel off the back sticker. Is Huawei trying to evade warranty liability in disguise?"
It broke twice after more than ten days after I bought it. Now I can’t even charge it. I bought it after reading so many good reviews. I don’t know if it was washed out.
It's cost-effective and the size is just right. I used it for two days before I reviewed it. I feel pretty good!
"The cell phone is bad, terribly bad. If it weren't for the urgent need to use a mobile phone and no time to go to a physical store to buy it, I really wouldn't want it. Lots of mobile phone problems"
"Mengniu has changed its packaging. It looks pretty good, but the smell is still the same. I just gave myself a carton of milk~"
"If you really love life and stay away from Mengniu, can you still drink domestic milk? Terensu also fell"
"I bought it as a gift for my sister, but the gift box I ordered together was not delivered. I was too drunk."
"The performance is good, and it is the first choice product if you can't afford an IPAD."
"This is too laggy, Snapdragon 616 is not as good as Snapdragon 615"
"Received the goods, no invoice. Customer service said it would be shipped with the product, but I didn't receive it."
I stopped drinking Mengniu a long time ago
"The resolution is terrible, the screen is too sensitive, and it takes too long to charge"
"I have been using it for several months, and it feels really average, a bit laggy, and the screen is not very clear."
"It's good to use, the packaging is very good, and the delivery is pretty timely. Let's check after using it for a few days."
I get extremely hot after playing Xiaoxiaole.
"Not satisfied. Just a few days after I bought it, there was a problem. There was no response when I touched the screen many times. I gave it a bad review!"
"The packaging is so crude, it doesn’t even contain any foam."
"I originally wanted to go sit down in the Barossa where my husband met me in the evening, but my son was so uninterested that he had to go to the supermarket! Fortunately, Mengniu’s yogurt tastes very good! Recommended!"
"The response was quick. After using it for a few days, there was no card issue. But the screen film is reflective. The memory card cannot be used."
I received the tablet and it looks very good. It feels very smooth when I use it. It’s great to buy a big item for the first time on JD.com!
"I hope everyone will not buy products from Mengniu and Yili, and say no to unscrupulous companies! An unscrupulous company makes mistakes again and again and refuses to change despite repeated admonitions! He kept saying: Just for a little bit of happiness! It's all nonsense"
The resolution is too low! I got less than 4 gigabytes of storage space!
"It's not bad. I don't use it much, but it's a bit heavy."
It gets very hot after just playing with it. It also gets very hot even if I don’t use it frequently. I regret buying it.
It's okay to buy for the elderly.
It’s ok. There’s no lag when playing King of Kings. It’s good for reading.
"Reply This PR is so spot on~ It’s a pity that the wolf has called too many times. Reply See your comment below =_= Instead of boycotting Japanese products, it is better to boycott Mengniu."
"It took me two days to write a review, just four words: I can’t put it down."
"The price is reduced as soon as you buy it, it’s an absolute scam!"
It’s so leisurely to sit at the end of the street and eat Mengniu’s ice cream. The key is that it was a bit late today and I didn’t buy the old ice cream from Hongqiang Restaurant. I'm so greedy for you... I'll make you unable to eat!
Bringing people the same surprise and happiness as Mengniu Sour Yogurt
No invoice was given and the price was reduced after purchase. Please explain why Migu Live cannot be opened.
"Remind friends again! Cherish life! Stay away from roadside stalls, roadside steamed buns, and cooked food. Stay away from Mengniu! For yourself and for the people you love! Repost Weibo"
Runs fast! Awesome! Awesome! I hope all domestic products are like this? B!
I bought it the night before and received it the next morning. JD.com’s logistics is pretty good. The tablet is very cost-effective and worth buying.
"Support Huawei, support domestic products"
"A very good tablet, with decent speed and clear calls! The standby time is also long enough, and it’s worth the money! Thank you JD.com, thank you Huawei, support domestic products."
"Very good. The service is very good, Midea is a big brand, trustworthy"
3G runs smoothly
"Support Mengniu, get one more. Thank you, support? Don’t want to wean off, hahaha ps.lucky"
It’s not bad. The screen is quite delicate. It’s worth buying a Kirin 950 at this price. Playing Honor of Kings and watching videos are also very smooth.
"Basically, it is a large-sized P10 Plus. I mainly bought it for the elderly to watch online videos, play cards, and read Wechat. After using it for a week, there was no problem in all aspects, and the performance and speed were okay!"
"Nice tablet, good for watching movies"
My son couldn't wait to use it after receiving it yesterday evening. Mainly to teach my son how to use English very well.
"It started to heat up after just half an hour of use, so I just played Xiaoxiaole. It wasn’t great. This star is for express delivery."
"This star is not for you, JD.com, nor for the Postal Service. See the pictures for yourself. How long will this service last? Is there water in the head or is it just a feces? Why can't I find express delivery, so I have to go to the postal service?"
"The workmanship of the tablet is okay, but generally speaking, it is average. The feature phone is basically satisfactory. I'm digging... If it doesn't work..."
Not bad to use
The resolution is too rubbish. It’s all grainy. Huawei is too rubbish! ! !
There is also room for improvement in touch screen sensitivity and accuracy.
It feels ok and the speed is quite fast. I bought it for an old lady. It should be fine for playing WeChat and watching TV series.
"I'm really annoyed! I am not satisfied with this purchase. The cover is only half a pack, not to mention that the magnetic force is too small and it will fall off. I am really dissatisfied. The tempered film sent also has a hole. I would like to return the product and strongly request return processing."
"If the quality is seriously substandard, there is still a long way to go to boycott Mengniu and Yili."
"This phone is the most difficult to use I have ever used. I originally wanted to use it as a tablet at home, so I bought a memory card and installed it. I didn’t download a few software or take a few photos, but it got stuck. It got stuck! If I had known earlier, I would have bought something else for the same money."
"Bad review! I just bought it yesterday and the price was reduced today. I am really speechless. I wasted 100 yuan in one day, which is higher than my salary. Bad review! Bad review! Bad review!"
"Bad review, not good, not even an invoice"
Children like it very much. Huawei is really good!
"Not clear, not good"
It hurts so much. It takes the same amount of time to charge and use. I basically charge it and use it throughout the day.
Beautiful little Mengniu~
"Not bad, very good, I also like the color."
"It's so small, it feels like it's not much bigger than a cell phone. I find it very difficult to use. Fooled. Not pretty. JD.com’s packaging is even more perfunctory. Don't want to say."
"No memory card! ! ! Drunk! ! ! ! That said, while supplies last! ! ! ! goodbye! ! ! ! No next time"
"It's either annoying or noisy every day. It's either noisy or suffocating. It's death no matter what, why can't we die happily? Someone give me a piece of Mengniu Sour Yogurt, I want the taste of happiness. @??wnan"
Works fine for now
"In fact, Mengniu cheats many more people than cutting cakes. Mengniu marketing is SB"
"The resolution is too low, prepare to return it, garbage, don’t buy it"
"I used it for two days to evaluate it. The system is smooth. There is no lag or heat. The battery is just average. I have a Huawei phone, so I don’t feel anything bad about it. It’s as smooth as a mobile phone."
Your sister! ! ! Bad review
Install it yourself and use it
The style is very beautiful and the speed is quite fast.
"Bought this for my kids to play with, I like it very much"
A birthday gift for my dad. He likes it very much and plays with it every day.
"This is the first time I bought a tablet. I have always used Huawei, so I also chose it for my first tablet. I bought it for my children to play games. They just like it. Good reviews."
"I bought it for my kids, some Android programs, the resolution is really bad! One star is for JD.com."
"I give a thumbs up to the domestic product, although I smashed the screen the day after I bought it and had to repair it...so I must buy broken screen insurance!"
"It's a broken thing, I bought it as a gift, but the charger doesn't work. I thought it was on the official website so I could buy it with confidence. Who knew something like this would happen. It pissed me off. Everyone should keep their eyes open when purchasing."
"Nothing to say, this thing is fast, feels good, and great"
"It's affordable and easy to use. It's good as a small tablet, but it's hard to put in your pocket. It's best to carry it in a handbag."
"Well, well, well, well, well! OK OK"
I haven't received the goods for more than half a month
"Appropriate size, looking forward to good performance during use"
Seeking profit only and lacking responsibility and dedication.
"I have been using it for two months before reviewing it. It is very easy to use. I can play games and watch movies without any lag at all. However, the screen is large and easy to break. It is recommended to buy accidental screen breakage insurance."
"The price is a bit expensive, but everything else is okay."
"It's pretty good. This is my first time buying a Huawei device, but it doesn't come with a tablet case. The image quality is fine."
"Too bad. For a thousand yuan mobile phone, it is better to buy a Xiaomi phone. The touch screen is also inferior."
Bad review! It said 16 G! It turned out to be only 8 G! I asked customer service and they said it was normal! Please give me a reasonable explanation.
It's so bad that it doesn't work after two days.
"Good, good, good, good, haha"
"Slow operation, poor ergonomics, poor sound quality"
"Very, very grateful to the domestic brand."
"I bought it for my uncle, I don’t know if it’s good or not."
"Every time I try to play Xiaoxiaole, I get stuck one after another. I don’t know if it’s genuine or not. Oh, I’m super disappointed."
"The tablet is very easy to use, five stars for JD.com. One star is for the courier, poor service quality"
It must have been used by someone else. It had a film on it and I was too lazy to return it.
"It's not easy to use, it's too bad."
"Too rubbish, the machine has problems, the screen has cracks, the price is cut too fast, disgusting, JD.com is going bankrupt"
I like Mengniu Yoyi C aloe vera flavor very much. I am in #6??# http:t.cn/zllhf3B
Jingdong logistics is very fast. The phone is OK to use. The quality is too poor. The screen box and the casing do not fit well and there are gaps. It rings when I press it with two fingers. It is very annoying. I don’t want to go through the trouble of returning or exchanging the product for money.
It’s easy to use and the logistics is fast. It’s a good choice.
"Super card machine, 32G has been changed to 24G, and the response is slow. It is recommended not to buy it. It is not worth the price."
Logistics is slower than promised and gifts were not delivered. Is this the service promised by JD.com? Garbage
"The speed is pretty good, luckily the one sold is 32G"
"How long has it been? During normal use, when I wake up in the morning and the screen is locked, the touch screen is completely malfunctioning. Pressing and holding the power button only restarts, and it's still a brick. When I came back in the evening, it was still the same, with no solution."
"Mengniu Big Fruit Beef is getting better and better than Snow White, and the whole strawberry"
"Needless to say, JD.com’s speed is fast!"
I have used it for a while before I can evaluate it. I mainly bought the machine for my parents to play games and so on. The quality is good and the screen is also very good.
Logistics is too bad
"It is said that among the previous Biao kings, Qinchi and Aido have gone bankrupt, and Bubu Gao is in danger. Mengniu fights hard to cope with the brand crisis. Is it the Biao king or the Biao king?"
"I don’t know, please ask customer service. I bought it for my son to play games."
"Damn it, why did you buy it for me to drink when I was in Beijing? Too toxic. Damn it. Too dark. Mengniu NULL-1 I dare not drink Mengniu in Beijing even though it has a monopoly on dairy products."
"I haven't had any problems with it so far. I don't play games. I use it for studying. It's pretty good. If you want a 960 processor, it would be even better!"
"Overall it's okay, the sound effect is good and the sound is quite loud. However, the GPS signal is not very good during navigation."
The electric water heater is very good and cost-effective. Customers can feel confident buying it.
The logistics is very fast. I bought it in the morning and used it in the afternoon. I bought it during the 618 event and it was very discounted. I hope there will be no quality problems. I trust Huawei.
"I bought it for 1858 yuan, which is not bad. The picture quality is very delicate and the size is suitable. I am still very satisfied!"
"The definition is too low and it looks a bit blurry. There are no headphones. I was promised that they would come with a film or cover, but they didn’t come with either. I’m very dissatisfied."
Why is the resolution so poor? It’s so blurry. I’ll return it if it doesn’t work.
I have fallen in love with you Mengniu Youyi C! I like the taste so much
It’s my first time to buy a tablet. It arrived today and it looks very good. I support domestic products. I hope you won’t disappoint me. The delivery person’s attitude is very good and I’m satisfied. I’d like it.
"Fast logistics / good quality and low price, worth buying"
"Great machine, sounds and runs great"
"Mengniu, a deceiver who refuses to change despite repeated admonitions! !"
"No, it can’t activate the electric panel. Even if I fall into the water, I can’t even think of the electric panel."
"The battery is sufficient, the screen is large, and the system is smooth. Huawei is proud to be a domestic product."
"very good! I like it very much, I'm very satisfied...Hahahahahaha I peed myself laughing..."
"Too bad, it says 16G, but it’s actually only 10G. The protective film and protective case are not included, and the customer service is not good. I keep making excuses. Please don’t buy it. You will regret it if you buy it..."
"I never thought about buying Mengniu again, but I couldn’t control it, it was too cruel..."
"I voted for the option ""Wang Xiaoshan will not drink Mengniu after boycotting""."
"I have been using it for just a few days. The screen definition is very poor. The other party receiving the video with poor pixels cannot see it clearly, and the response is very slow. I personally recommend it but I don’t know whether to buy it."
"The express delivery is very good, and the tablet is also very stylish. It runs smoothly and you can watch movies very clearly."
No fun without headphones
The only way to show your respect is not to buy Mengniu. The number one counterfeiter in the dairy industry was killed. Sad and indignant @???
"I bought 3 units, two broke down, one won't turn on, and one has a broken screen."
"Very good, LTE, practical. Huawei is now getting closer and closer to the quality of American products. Domestic products no longer rely on low prices to attract consumers. This is really a leap in quality (I am referring to Huawei p10)"
The performance is very good. The display and running speed are awesome. Support domestic core! ! ! It’s just that the arc on the back is a bit disappointing
"The price was unstable and kept floating. It went up and down when it wanted to, and it took 2 days to drop*. Not sincere."
"Searching for reviews online, I found reviews saying that this touch screen is really not that good."
I have one myself and it works well. I took a picture of it for my mother.
"The price has been greatly reduced, and the reviews are bad. The price of the iPad I just bought was also reduced within a few days. I don’t want to give it a single star. I have no love for JD.com. I will try not to buy from JD.com in the future. I can’t bear the big wave."
"It's very good. I bought it first for my husband, and then I bought one for my dad. So far, it's working pretty well."
"Great value for money, very good, fast delivery!"
It feels good and the size is just right. I just received it yesterday and will use it to see how the quality is.
"I have been thinking about it for a long time. I show my parents videos, news and stuff. The fonts are big and the voice is good. I'll burn it first after buying it. You can hold it and read it, it’s more convenient than a laptop, and it’s also very light. The best thing I can tell you is that the elderly don’t need to wear glasses. whee"
"After I was revived on the spot, my mother asked me what brand of milk I drank. I said, Germany has it. My mother said, look, foreign viruses are more terrifying. If you are directly poisoned, you can’t find compensation. You might as well drink Mengniu!"
Mengniu's pure ice is my favorite among all! ! !
Just wait for the original poster to starve to death or be poisoned by Mengniu or something like that.
"It seems that I am really not suitable for drinking Mengniu pure milk. I feel so uncomfortable now. I really want to vomit but I can’t. Wow, I feel like crying."
"When I first bought it, it looked okay on the outside, but it was so rubbish on the inside. Sometimes it was stuck while watching movies, and I didn’t dare to download anything. It crashed very easily. To be honest, I don’t want to give it even one star."
Very dissatisfied! It took a long time to add the ticket!
There are a lot of gifts and the company holds activities that everyone likes.
The confirmation was late and it has not been installed yet. I will wait for the after-sales service to complete the installation before commenting.
"I'm not here to give a review, I'm just saying it with facts. The WiFi reception ability is not very good, the screen is slightly stuck, and the pixels are average. It's actually nothing. The main reason is that since it's a computer and the networking ability is not good, everything I say is nonsense~"
"The delivery is fast, but the pixels are really low and the response is not very fast. I bought it for an old man to video chat with his grandson, so I can only make do with it."
"The heat dissipation is good, the operation is smooth, and the appearance is good, but the touch is a bit unresponsive."
"I was on a business trip, so I was worried about whether I could receive the goods in time at the hotel. The result was received on time, and you can still shop through JD.com even when you are on a business trip?"
My wife likes it very much and is very happy. The speed is so fast. I ordered it at 0 o'clock in the evening and it arrived at noon. Express delivery is so awesome.
"It's such a broken phone. When I told customer service about the problem, the customer service didn't answer. Bad review"
The most authentic Mengniu advertising slogan.
Slow response. Haven’t played Legend yet? The phone responds quickly.
"Playing Honor of Kings is very fast, but the screen is too big and difficult to operate. I can’t even execute a beheading with one hand haha?_?Good review"
"It's average, the resolution is not high, it's not clear when watching TV series, and sometimes there are computer freeze problems, so just make do with it!"
I bought a tablet for a friend and there is no problem. I believe JD.com operates it on its own. Huawei quality is trustworthy
The milk distributed in parent-child classes may be aware of its bad reputation. Mengniu’s logo is hidden in a small seam.
"The logistics speed is very fast, and my son likes it very much after buying it. The speed of the tablet is also relatively smooth, and it looks good."
"Mengniu is not planned, but built with solid products, services and systems."
Why not? Deceiving customers like this
Honor of Kings runs smoothly.
"It doesn’t come with a film or case, so it’s not a set at all."
"3G storage, operation response is relatively fast ~"
"I don’t know what’s going on on JD.com? I ordered a gold one, but they got a white one as a gift. It’s not easy to use and doesn’t work well when I touch it. I’m really disappointed! Bad review."
"Cheap price, fast delivery, good quality"
"There is no invoice, although I don’t need it. The express packaging is a bit crude, there is no filler, and it has not been used yet."
I bought it for my company. I always buy things from JD.com. I think it’s pretty good. I think it’s trustworthy! ! ! !
"The things are very ordinary, not even headphones are provided"
"It’s too laggy, the screen is unclear at all, the battery is not fully charged, and the QR code cannot be scanned via WeChat. There are so many problems and no return. I advise everyone not to buy it."
"This phone is really rubbish, I thought it was a refurbished phone"
"A piece of rubbish, not bad. . ."
"Flash sale, very affordable, profitable!"
"It's working well so far, the color and size are just right."
The battery is relatively durable. I believe Huawei supports domestic production.
This is my first time using Huawei. The phone is new and I feel pretty good at first.
Why can’t I connect wirelessly or connect automatically? The matter has been returned.
The worst Huawei product I have ever bought. The screen is a highlight. I am really impressed.
"Not bad, I caught up with the JD.com event"
"Ordered at night, arrived in the morning, logistics was great. The tablet is good. It is enough for my mother to read news on WeChat."
"The tablet has high configuration, fast running speed, golden appearance, and comfortable viewing. 5 points."
Nice gift for dad
"The official media has begun to criticize Mengniu, and the top management may have given up."
"The performance is good, the heat dissipation effect is good, and the standby time is long. The large screen is convenient for surfing the Internet and is great for navigation while driving."
I think Mengniu Deluxe is the best...
"Huawei's products may not be the most cost-effective, but they are worth the price."
"The stuff is okay, but it doesn’t feel very responsive, but I bought it for the elderly to watch TV, and it’s okay."
"Jingdong is really good at it. The price dropped just two days after I bought it. I forgot to save the order number and called customer service and the price went up again. Did anyone see it? It was 1288 before 9 o'clock on June 7th. After calling customer service, it went back to 1386."
"It looks good, let’s try it first!"
"I like the slimness and beauty of the m3, the large screen is very clear, and the response speed is good."
"The phone feels like I bought it second-hand. Let me explain it by looking at the picture. When I came back to set it up myself, I found that someone else had set it up and the numbers were still there. One star was for express delivery."
The screen is big and it's fast. It’s fun to watch the video.
"The reviews are bad, they don’t give away what they say they come with, and they also recommend it and say it’s very good. I used to support domestic products, but this is such a T* M**D* trap. I will never buy from Huawei again."
The price dropped just a few days after I bought it. I’m so unhappy. I’ve lost a lot! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"It’s not good at all, it’s very stuck and hard to use! It's been ten days since I bought it today, and now I can no longer charge it."
Slow response and stuck
Why is there only 11G of 16G storage? Is there such a huge difference to deceive consumers? I bought 8G. Does it only have 5G? I have to return it unconditionally within seven days.
"It's quite rubbish. If you haven't bought it, please don't buy it. The resolution is super low, the pixels are poor, and the signal is weak."
"Not bad, I’m very satisfied with it in every aspect after using it for the time being."
"When I caught up with the Huawei tablet event, I also received a film, case and LeTV card. It was a great deal. The Huawei tablet is as fast as fruit. It is as easy to operate as a mobile phone and has first-class workmanship."
"Very good, good acoustics. I really like it, and it took me a while to review it."
I just bought it during the Double 11 event and it was reduced to * just one day before the 12th. Jingdong is self-operated. What is this? I asked the after-sales service and said that the price on the website shall prevail. Jingdong also lied to people. Take a look. I can’t trust future activities. To Jingdong Disappointed.
"I bought one for myself and two for others. The response is fast, but it is a bit big. Occasionally the video cannot be played, but it is durable."
"From now on, I will not drink Mengniu even if I die of thirst, I will only give Mengniu to my enemies. This stuff is so poisonous, I think weightlifters can use it when they want to lose weight..."
"The phone is big, the camera is clear, and the price is affordable!"
"Not bad. I have bought several of them, and the quality is still passable. I don’t know yet whether it will take long or not. . ."
"Mengniu, bragging vigorously."
"One word, good. Smoothness, color, and sound are all good. I love Huawei."
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it, the difference is quite a bit, I don’t want to say more, it’s a bad review."
"Bad goods, bad reviews, one star for express delivery"
"I bought the third one. After buying it for my aunt, her sister looked good and asked me to buy another one."
"The screen flickers when watching the video, even if I change another one, the same thing still happens"
An enlarged version of a mobile phone. It’s fun to watch TV series and movies. It’s easy to carry around.
It's not as good as expected. The GPU is not good and it's stuck when playing Honkai Impact 3. The packaging is not good either
"I am used to using Apple and I definitely feel stuck when using Android. But when I think about the price, I feel relieved. Good reviews. Support domestic production."
"It’s okay, my mom likes it very much. At first I saw that the parameters were quite low and there was no lag as expected. It was quite smooth and highly recommended."
"When I bought it, I was told that it would arrive the next day, but after I finished the purchase, it showed that it had been transferred from another place. A week passed after the order was transferred. As soon as it arrived, I saw that the same tablet was on sale, and it was a hundred yuan cheaper. It’s Jingdong!"
"Not bad, worth the price"
"Bought for a friend, very satisfied"
The resolution is too bad. Hurts eyes.
I can’t save the photos I took with my mobile phone. The customer service attitude is bad and they won’t reply.
I can't connect to WIFI. It seems that cheap things should be carefully considered. I have applied for after-sales service and hope it can be solved as soon as possible.
"Watch a movie with various cards, they are really cheap but not good ones! ! ! In addition, it is estimated that many of the machines that have been on the market for a long time are refurbished machines."
"If you can buy this tablet at this price, it’s worth it. It supports Huawei and domestic products."
"It's okay to use, but the workmanship is very poor. Not long after using it, the plastic parts at the corners have started to crack. I'm very dissatisfied."
The response is faster and the battery lasts longer. The only drawback is that my USB charging interface cable is very loose when plugged in!
It is currently in good use and is suitable for children and the elderly to watch movies and play games!
It’s not easy to use. It’s very laggy when playing games and the signal connection is poor.
"You're cheating on me, Jingdou, I'm so angry"
Good quality and low price! ! ! ………………
"If you buy it to play games, you should buy a larger memory. I feel that the 32 memory is still relatively small. The other ones are fine. I haven't found any problems yet. The packaging should be strengthened. There is no protection inside, so I just throw it in there."
"I just received it today and found a lot of problems. The earphones are not included and the membrane is not even attached. Is it necessary to save so much? Also, the signal of this broken phone is not good. The 4G network always has no signal and the screen is not clear."
This is the fourth one I bought. I really like it. I trust JD.com as always.
Reply That’s so polite! Still serving at such a late hour! …Thanks for supporting Mengniu products
The screen is not very good?
Very useful! The acoustics are good.
"Why is Mengniu, a state-owned enterprise, so good? @Angel813: Mengniu has repeatedly encountered problems, but no regulatory authorities have punished it, and Mengniu has not apologized. Advertisements are flying everywhere. Why is Mengniu so awesome?"
"I just got the phone, I will give it a review after using it for a few days to see if I am satisfied!"
The product is damaged and I am returning it. It depends on whether the after-sales service is OK.
"Before I got the item, it showed that I had signed for it, and JD.com’s service was also speechless."
"The packaging is in good condition. It is my first time to buy a tablet. After using it slowly to get a feel for it, there should be no major problems."
"The product is good, but it’s a pity that there are no gifts. The tempered film of the leather case must be purchased separately."
"Not bad, 999 yuan,"
"No leather case included, bad review."
Everything else is okay. The screen freezes when playing mobile games. I submitted the return application but still no reply.
"The price I bought for the event is very affordable. The screen is very clear, the standby time is smooth, but there are a little black edges. The price/performance ratio is very high."
"I don’t want to give it a heart, it’s rubbish, the screen is blurry after just a month or two, it’s even rubbish than a copycat phone, not all Huawei’s big brands are good, and the customer service is indifferent."
"Don’t buy it, those good reviews are all based on brushes. When playing Honor of Kings, the direction keys don’t work. When asking customer service, it always says that the customer service staff is not there to leave a message. This is the kind of service JD.com has. I will never come to JD.com again."
"Very good, I trust JD.com."
"It was sent like this without even a bubble bag. If it weren't for the good service attitude of the courier guy, I would have refused it."
Support JD as always. Support JD as always.
Resolution difference! ! ! ! !
"I turned it on and tried it, and it feels very good! The accessories provided are also very good! The packaging is exquisite, the accessories are complete, and it comes with a protective film, which shows that it takes consumers seriously!"
"It feels okay, it’s worthy of the price!"
"Not bad. After using it for a while, I feel that the battery is draining quickly."
"Jingdong delivery is a big pitfall. No phone calls were made, and the goods were simply left at someone else's house. Without confirming with the other party, just throw it away and leave."
"Comprehensive indicators from all aspects show that this tablet is equivalent to the Xiaomi Mi Pad 2, but the operation does not feel as smooth as the Xiaomi Mi Pad 2. However, I think there is one more outstanding advantage, that is, the sound effect is good."
Looks pretty good
"The service is so rubbish. They say they can watch Sohu blockbusters, but they can’t. It’s too deceptive."
Bad review! ! ! Serious crash! ! ! And the resolution is too low! ! ! The screen is yellow! ! ! !
"To be honest, it's not that good. It was stuck the first day I got it. It was really stuck!"
The resolution is really too low.
"It took me a while to review it, but it’s so hard to use. Sometimes the screen goes black when watching videos, sometimes there’s no sound, and the delivery is too slow! ! !"
"I trust Jingdong! Cheap, affordable and fast shipping!"
"Very good tablet, very easy to use and looks good"
"Very good, very satisfied with an online purchase."
"Bought for my mother, very cost-effective for daily leisure and entertainment use"
"Yes, it looks great! !"
"I bought it on Double Eleven and haven’t installed it yet, but I’m very satisfied!"
"No invoice, no resolution! My eyes hurt from playing games! ! ! I have no use for the WeChat lic770 required by LeTV members and Zhuxian cdk."
It took 6 days. broken. Check it yourself. The manufacturer replaced it.
"The initial experience of using it is good. After I applied the film, I immediately got a lot of fingerprints on it. There was no smear. There is no lag at the moment."
"It's too big, and it's not as good as expected. It was upgraded to N times, and it died twice. The screen was on for no reason, and the battery capacity was not as good as the 5000 mAh one."
"Someone has endorsed Mengniu Sour Yoghurt, and Mengniu seems to like to let relevant personnel visit the production line. The cows in the Mengniu cattle farm are very powerful == Have you really seen it? ? Teenager forward Weibo"
Very cost-effective and easy to use. The quality is great.
Is it refurbished? The standby time is very short and difficult to use. The phone is also very light.
"This tablet is just the right size and has a clear screen, which is great for playing games and watching videos. You can install Google directly without root!"
"When I bought it, I was told that there was no discount, but there was a discount the next day, which was very frustrating..."
"It’s so disgusting. Fortunately, I don’t drink Mengniu, let alone Deluxe."
"I have replaced it three times, but there is still a problem. It may be that the power button and volume button of this batch are super loose. If I accidentally pick it up and touch it, I will press it. I am tired of changing it, so I will not change it. Thumbs up for JD.com’s after-sales service. It’s terrible. of Huawei"
"The clarity is extremely high, the standby time is long, the sound effects are stereo, and it’s a great shopping experience!"
"New Mengniu, Xin Mengniu, and new president, we are confident to do better!"
"I believe that the Huawei brand has been used quite well, and the price is now higher than when I bought it. Haha, I made dozens of dollars."
The tablet responds quickly. Buy the tablet on JD.com
"Been using it for a while, it's very good"
"It's very rubbish, it's stuck terribly, I regret buying it! Not to mention the standby time!"
"The phone is good, customer service... haha"
The standby time is too short. The phone can only be used for one day without being connected to the Internet or playing with it. I asked customer service and they said that the battery of this phone can only be used for one day. I was also drunk and very disappointed.
"Mengniu is not good, Yili is not good, and now even Guangming is having problems. Is there any milk to drink?"
The resolution and wifi reception signal are bad! ! !
"The bastard customer service has asked questions but no one has answered them for several days. If I have any after-sales questions, I don’t know who to call. Such a service should be closed soon."
The speed is so slow and the delivery person is not very helpful.
"Jingdong’s activities are quite impressive. They give away membranes, leather cases and LeTV membership cards, which are much cheaper than in physical stores."
"It took three days for the express to arrive, but I didn’t receive it. The courier said he was too busy to deliver it. JD customer service said it was a normal express delivery, so please be patient. What the hell is this! So I really don’t know if the stuff is good or not."
I bought it for someone else and it's said to be pretty good.
"Not bad, not bad. I updated the system when I got it back. Now the whole family uses Huawei."
"Who allowed me to have a godfather like COFCO? Why is Mengniu so awesome? @Angel813: Mengniu has repeatedly encountered problems, but no regulatory authorities have punished it, and Mengniu has not apologized. Advertisements are flying everywhere. Why is Mengniu so awesome?"
I often get disconnected when using 3G to surf the Internet. I’m disappointed with my shopping. It’s cheap but not easy to buy!
"Secondly, the packaging. Jingdong’s packaging is getting worse and worse. It’s just filled with stuffing on one side, which is confusing."
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"Tablet is good, logistics is rubbish"
"Generally, generally, generally, generally"
Huawei's products have always been good. The domestic product control and craftsmanship have been improved. The price/performance ratio is not good. I bought it because of the good quality. It is also made in China.
It looks more atmospheric and feels good in hand.
"I don’t like Mengniu, it always has a weird paint pen smell"
It’s not bad. It’s no problem to watch movies and the price is not expensive.
"Not bad, not bad, just in time for the event, the battery life is great d=(??)=b"
"It feels pretty good, relatively fast, stable, and no lag."
I’m more optimistic about the French red wine imported original calf leather.
"Bad, bad, bad! Super rubbish! Black-hearted boss! Are the toys better than you?"
It's very useful. I use it all the time without any problems.
"The packaging is just put in a cardboard box without any padding. After all, it’s a small two thousand product. As soon as I bought it, the video lags and plots appear at every turn. Is this genuine? Worst experience on JD.com"
"I don’t feel good, the service attitude is too bad, they are all uncles, the gifts are not bare metal, invoices are not issued, and the customer service cannot be contacted, which is a black point"
This is the price of cheating in the past. Mengniu is shameless. .
"I received it yesterday and tried it out. It's fine in every aspect. I'm just used to Apple's high resolution, but suddenly I feel a bit uncomfortable when I use this one. The resolution is a bit low!"
"It seems okay, I bought it for the elderly at home. It's just that you need to upgrade the system after you get it, which is inconvenient, and it won't work without the Internet. Overall good!"
"The sound is suddenly louder and softer. I suspect there is something wrong with the mic. Try again for a few days. If it doesn't work, I need to return it."
"Mengniu taro flavored ice cream is so delicious, I love the taste! Beautiful!"
"What about gifts? Where is the bag? Once you buy it, it’s gone? ? Isn't it bad to deceive people like this?"
Believe in Huawei and use Huawei all the time.
"This mobile phone is really not worth buying. I bought it for a few hundred yuan for my family. It’s really annoying. It broke down within a few days of use. Now it has another problem. I originally believed that it was made in China, but now the quality is beyond words. describe"
Is this event sponsored by Mengniu?
The battery is very hot and not very durable. Charging is very slow. This is the first time I come to JD.com and it will also be the last time.
Huawei quality is as good as ever!
The quality is very good and the logistics is fast
"After using it for a while, it is very smooth and worth it."
Very easy to use
It took a day! It feels fast!
"Reposting one, I was blackened when melamine came out! ! Damn it, Mengniu’s production line is crazy. I really don’t dare to drink anymore. Repost on Weibo."
"Easy to use! Watching videos is smooth, the operating system is pretty good, and the price is even better!"
I will never buy anything from Huawei again.
It only took a few hours after I received it and it’s so damaged that it can’t be repaired.
I'm still satisfied with the phone. Don't talk about logistics. It's very exciting just talking about it. Jingdong customer service also feels like it's okay not to talk about it. Everything is sudden.
"To be honest, online shopping is really not that good."
"The price-performance ratio is pretty good, but after buying 16g, you only have 7g left to use. It seems that you will still have to buy a card in the future. It can run large games without lag."
"Overall, this Huawei tablet is good and supports domestic production!"
"There are very few negative reviews when shopping. real. Buyers should consider carefully. After all, the price is not worth it."
Mengniu’s new banana organic milk is delicious~
"Rubbish, the video looks too laggy, the resolution is like a mobile phone screen from ten years ago! !"
"The quality is good, I will continue to buy it next time."
The logistics is very fast. The tablet is indeed very good. The sound quality is very good and the video is very clear. The Huawei tablet is worth buying.
Mengniu is delicious! I always eat orange flavor~
I bought it for my elders. It doesn’t require high configuration. It’s just for playing cards and watching movies. It’s a suitable size. The key is that it’s cheap. It’s very worth it.
Why not give an invoice and evade taxes?
"If you want to live to ninety-nine, please give up your cigarettes; if you are helpless, drink more Mengniu and eat less vegetables!"
The machine broke down within a month of use. I took it to Huawei’s after-sales service department for repairs. They said the motherboard of the tablet was broken and they replaced it with a new motherboard for free. Huawei’s after-sales service is good and it’s still working fine.
"I didn’t expect that Huawei also makes good-looking tablets, no worse than Apple and Samsung. The tablets are beautiful and the sound quality is also good. The price is not high and it’s worth buying, but it doesn’t come with anything, so I still have to buy it."
"Study hard, make progress every day, study hard"
"It runs fast, the touch screen is very sensitive, the screen is clear, the system is smooth, it is good for watching movies, and the sound quality is good."
"Bad review, the items were not delivered to my home, only to the countryside, the express delivery was too irresponsible."
"The tablet is very good, the screen is clear, but the 32g memory is not enough, and it comes with a lot of stuff. I feel like this is a common problem with Huawei, and my mate9 is also like this. I hope Huawei can improve further."
"The stuff is good, I feel good when I wear it, it’s worth buying"
"The Internet speed is really slow, and I still have 4G. When I go to play the Water Margin card game, it freezes like crazy! ! !"
A series of scandals have shown that Mengniu's management quality is poor and its corporate governance is in disarray. Consumers should refuse to buy its products.
It doesn’t matter if the casing and earphones are not included. The film is not included. You can’t buy this model in places where the film is applied on the outside. The running speed is average and the screen is relatively small. Bad review!
very good! It runs smoothly and is easy to use. Huawei is great and supports it!
Logistics is a mess
It’s too laggy. I’ll just play a mobile game. It’s really laggy. It’s really laggy. I’d better not buy it if I want to play the game.
"Disappointed, low pixels, low resolution, and often freezes when taking pictures"
"This is JD.com’s service. No loan inspection will be allowed without a signature. I wonder if the items were stolen or exchanged? Those legs were delivered by courier, and they were captured because they were afraid that Beijing wouldn't admit their fault. Pingla doesn't even have Chinese handwriting input. The protective cover is rubbish. *"
"This day really happened. I was also on vacation during those days, thank you to Mengniu for your hard work. The Mengniu milk was produced on February 30. Mengniu has worked hard, and COFCO has worked hard! It's hard work"
The system patrols smoothly and the touch screen is sensitive.
"Very bad, fingerprint cannot be used"
"There is no problem with the machine, the Kirin 950 is still running smoothly."
"After purchasing, I went to China Mobile to change the card, and the mobile lobby cost only 2488. I can also use 600 coupons, and it only cost 1888. Jingdong is even more expensive."
This kind of company should be shut down if found! All relevant responsible persons and leaders will be punished in accordance with the law! Mengniu should also close down! ! ! An unscrupulous businessman paired with an unscrupulous manager will die without mercy! ! !
"Pretty good stuff. All phones are from Huawei, and tablets are also from Huawei."
"The screen is not clear and the button response is slow. At most, it is just a cartoon for children to watch."
"The express delivery speed is good, and the packaging is not foamy, so it is a three-star."
"It’s too bad. There is no leather case or stent, not even a protective film. It’s too bad. Friends, keep your eyes peeled!"
Very satisfied
It's stuck like hell. . . . . .
"Because I don’t play mobile games very much, I chose this m3 which combines clarity, sound quality, and a screen ratio of 16:10. I was not disappointed. Haha, I support Huawei!"
"It took me some time to watch a movie, it’s good, it’s good quality and fast, it’s very good"
"Mengniu, awesome!"
Bought for a friend who likes it very much. Very good tablet. Affordable. Supports JD.com.
This one is 15 years old. It looks great and can be used.
The logistics is great and it is very easy to use. I bought it for my children. I like it very much.
It's very good to use and feels good in the hand.
I bought it for a friend’s child and said it’s good.
That bit of Mengniu advertising is pretty good.
"The speed is quite fast, and Huawei’s quality is outstanding."
The phone is good and very easy to use.
"After using it for more than half a month, the external amplifier hardware broke and the microphone broke."
"After using it for a month, the machine is laggy. It’s really rubbish."
"The camera is really bad, the resolution is too poor, and it's too stuck. I thought it was a good thing, but it turned out to be garbage, too dark, and not worth the money at all."
"Very nice board, very nice clothes, very suitable mask. The 5.2-inch Honor Xiaoqi and its sister the 8.4-inch M3."
"It consumes power very quickly, so I charge it two or three times a day, which is a bit regretful."
"The goods that arrived today are very good to use, but I bought the Huawei M2 Youth Edition and what I received was the Huawei M2 Lanyue..."
"Damn, the charger was broken when I got it. It shows that the charge is insufficient and the more it is charged, the less it is."
"Received the product, logistics is fast, Huawei quality is very good, like it."
"I want to give zero points, but there is no option for zero points. This machine really disappoints me."
"There is no case for the phone, and the resolution is super low. Very poor............................. .."
"Overall satisfied. No film, no gifts. I bought it for my baby to watch cartoons. It’s enough. It’s no problem to use. Now everyone at home is switching to Huawei."
"Very good, Jingdong’s products are trustworthy, I will come again next time"
"It was a very unhappy shopping experience, because if it was not within the scope of the gifts, you could just buy it yourself. Why buy more if there were gifts? As a result, one thing was completed several times and took a lot of time. I concluded that I was too stupid."
"Sanlu and Mengniu are terrible. Beijing’s Sanyuan, which I have been drinking since childhood, is the most reliable."
This tablet is really easy to use. Very powerful.
"Haha, I was also very surprised. Mengniu customer service replied to me just after sending the message."
"I really like this tablet, it's beautiful."
"The fingerprint unlocking is very sensitive, not for playing games, but for office use, it is very smooth."
Very good and easy to use. . . . . . . . It’s just that the screen is a little darker
"Huawei is really good. I am currently using this one I just received to evaluate it. I like it very much. Although it's a little expensive, I think it's worth it."
"Bad review, not even earplugs, not even the most basic things like a mobile phone"
"It sucks, don’t buy it. The goods sent by JD.com are obviously not new, they have been disassembled."
The courier was too rude and said he wouldn't let me open the box for inspection.
I just bought it and the price was reduced by 250 yuan. It’s called a flash sale. I really don’t think the customer’s money is money.
The Huawei M3 tablet is really good. The sound quality and resolution feel better than Apple tablets. The price is also very reasonable and supports domestic products.
"It feels good when I first picked it up. This value. It’s just that the film should have two layers, but it’s only one layer. The top layer is missing, giving people the same feeling as if it has been used."
The express service attitude is very good. I folded it and saw that there was no invoice. I contacted the service and they said there was no invoice. I said JD.com had no invoice for its own operation and said I had no choice. Bad review! Bad review!
"I’m super unhappy. The price dropped just two days after I bought it. I’m tired of the difference and don’t like it anymore. I bought them all during Double Eleven, and the merchants are not kind."
"Can you check Mengniu, Yili and Guangming first? I very much support domestically produced milk. In order for these companies to better serve the people, I have stopped breastfeeding for 3 years~"
It just arrived and I couldn’t wait to open it and use it. It’s very smooth and the effect is very good. I’m very satisfied.
Not installed yet! Add after use!
Rubbish. . . . . . . . . It's so stuck
The resolution is so low that I regret buying it. Domestic products just don’t work. They are still different from other products. Let’s not make a fool of ourselves. It really doesn’t work.
"Not bad, it looks good and works well"
"Yes, the price/performance ratio is quite suitable. I bought it during the flash sale on the hour. It was just the right time to buy it."
"Mengniu is right, it’s the experts and foreigners who didn’t understand it properly!"
"When I first bought it, I couldn’t play Tencent Video after installing it. I had to restart it. Then every time I watched it for a period of time, I had to restart it before I could watch the video. I don’t know why. You get what you pay for. I’m speechless."
"The price of the mobile phone I bought on Tuesday was reduced by 200 today... I asked customer service, and they said it was a limited-purchase product, so it didn't support price guarantees... It didn't say that it was a limited-purchase product when I bought it! So shameless, you really know how to deceive!"
"It's something for customers to use, it's not bad."
It took two days to receive it. The quality of the phone is safe for the time being.
"I will never buy Huawei mobile phones again, they are stuck, especially when playing Honor of Kings."
"The stuff is really average, it just feels like a defective product with incomplete design. The battery is too weak. I’ll buy more iPad mini bars in the future."
No shell film included. I bought it because JD.com has a self-operated guarantee. The resolution is not as good when the screen is larger. I regret it a bit!
"The quality of the stuff is very good, I like it"
"After only using it for a few days, the screen failed. It was cheap but not good, and it couldn’t play games. It also crashed."
resist! No more Mengniu! ! ! Mengniu is a company without conscience. Boycott Mengniu!
"Fortunately, I bought one for my mother and aunt. The price is not expensive and the requirements are not high. Suitable to buy for the elderly."
It supports domestic products. M3 is really good. It is fast and responsive. Especially the sound is really good and three-dimensional. The picture is also very clear and the picture quality is good. I am very satisfied!
It’s just for making calls. Why does a new phone need to be charged every day? Very dissatisfied. Not recommended to buy.
"It is said to be dual-SIM dual-standby and supports memory card expansion up to 128g. When I got it, I discovered that the memory card cannot be used with dual-SIM dual-standby. Secondly, it is too big for a mobile phone!"
What can I say about this product? It just runs very slowly. I couldn’t even react after watching a movie for half a day. I was also speechless.
"For us elderly people, it is very satisfying and convenient for watching TV series."
great great great great
"Very good, the tempered film provided is very useful. This is my first time buying a Huawei product, and I hope it won’t disappoint me."
"It’s so scary. I wonder if there’s something wrong with the yogurt? Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu. Abo's Exposure Zone: After drinking milk in a Xiamen hotel, a woman found dozens of live worms in the bowl"
"It didn't arrive within the time limit, and the packaging was irregular. I couldn't tell it was an electrical appliance, but thought it was food. The machine itself passed the test, and the price was no better than other merchants. jd is no longer the most competitive supplier"
"The stuff is okay, but my wife scolded me after I bought it, so I can’t do anything about it."
"Because I was forced to choose a gift when I bought it, and the price dropped within a few days, so when I applied for price protection, my application failed because there was a gift? What kind of bad reason is this? ! Did I really want your gift when I bought it?"
"Only 3G network can be used. The screen has a very grainy feel, large black edges, and is very thick. I don’t know how old the product is!"
"Boycott Japanese products for half a year, and never drink Mengniu for the rest of my life."
So I don’t drink Mengniu and I have never liked Mengniu.
"It's great to watch videos, the WiFi signal is strong, the price is a bit expensive, and the operation is the same as a mobile phone, it is actually a large-screen mobile phone."
"I bought a TV watch for my mother, okay?"
"What a crappy tablet, the screen went black after two minutes of watching a video! There is a serious problem with the system!"
Huawei (HUAWEI) M2 8.0-inch tablet computer 1920×1200 Kirin 930 Harman Kardon sound effect 3G/16G WiFi) Moonlight Silver ?999 Very good
I don’t know why the screen keeps going black and white! !
"Bought for my mother and sister to read e-books and play games? The 8.4-inch one is quite enjoyable. It's just that the protective case was not delivered when I took the photo. Even if you don't have the goods, you can send it in other colors. This is too much. This is the difference between JD.com and *"
"Buy it to watch children's songs for your baby, so you don't have to compete with us all the time for TV. I bought it for the audio and video effect, it is really good, and it has a speaker on the top and bottom, and the stereo sound effect is great. I also got a one-year LeTV membership for free, which was so cool!"
"The tablet is very good, the wifi signal is good, and it’s great for playing King of Kings."
The screen resolution is poor. It feels very bad. It’s not as good as Apple. It heats up in less than 10 minutes.
A happy little Mengniu
Mom likes it very much.
"I've been using it for a while, and it feels good to use, the size is right, and I can play games and everything smoothly."
"The appearance of the notebook is good, but the display is a bit poor. I can only say that the display effect at this price is too bad."
"The battery life is so bad. I can’t even stay on standby for a whole day even with Super Power Saving turned on. Even if I change the battery, it’s still the same. Fingerprints on the back often fail to be recognized. It’s not a bad thing!"
"This is the first time I bought a tablet. I am quite satisfied with it, but it is not as fast as the 3G version of a mobile phone. However, a tablet worth 1,000 yuan is pretty good."
"What, even though it’s not very valuable, the packaging is too small, and it doesn’t come with anything. I almost thought it didn’t include a charger."
The screen freezes when I turn it on and I can't watch it at all. From expectation to disappointment! What’s commendable is that JD.com’s delivery is very fast!
Not bad. My colleagues all said it was good. It exceeded expectations and was well received.
Very good product. Jingdong logistics is fast. The product is very good and supports purchase.
"Not so good? Pixels don’t work,"
"I just bought it two days ago and the price has dropped! It’s all during the event, this is too deceiving!"
"I bought it for an event. It is a tablet that can make calls. I usually use it to watch videos and so on. This tablet is probably because it is cheap. The pixels are not very good, and the front camera pixels are relatively low. Everything else is pretty good"
"My Christmas gift, Mengniu Niu, I love it so much!"
I can only say that you get what you pay for. I just used it for one night and it felt a little laggy. It’s not as good as what I said online. I don’t think it’s easy to use. I don’t mind buying it. It’s also very heavy. It’s very thick and the resolution is very poor.
"Incredible package, 10-inch tablet with 7-inch tempered film"
"It's perfect, runs smoothly, has incomparable compatibility, and the screen and sound effects are domestically produced products! A perfect choice!"
"How could it be like this? The game crashed halfway through the game. It's because I don't know how to play or something, but I get stuck watching TV for two hours. Jingdong, are you sure you didn’t cheat me?"
"It’s really not that good, it doesn’t even have a sticker."
"The tablet is very easy to use. My children play with it every day, even if they drop a lot of things by throwing it, it still runs smoothly! !"
Full marks for this price. It is an option for students without financial resources.
"Very good, I am very satisfied with Huawei's products this time. It feels better than the quality of mobile phones. Playing Honor of Kings is stress-free. Send the king. ."
Mengniu is restless
I was tricked into drinking half a box of Mengniu that was expired for a year.
"Not very good, there is something wrong with the screen, and there is also a problem with the card?"
"All points are high. I can't turn off system updates, and they keep popping up and pushing. Moreover, Huawei customer service directly said that they can't solve it. I suggest buyers not to be fooled."
Home Appliances Mengniu is an evil black-hearted enterprise and a hateful black-hearted beauty. Please forward it! !
"Jingdong disappoints me and makes me sad. . I took it back for repair a month ago and complained about the problem. . Only half a month later, the same problem occurred again! Jingdong Mall wants to give me an explanation."
Is there no customer service?
The baby has been received. It is very useful.
"The phone was given as a gift, so I don’t know if it’s good or not, but the price dropped within a few days of buying it, and I wasn’t in a good mood."
"Very good, arrived on the same day"
The first thing you notice when you get it is that it has a plastic casing. Isn’t it a metal body? I feel like lying to me
"I wanted to buy a tablet, so I bought it directly from JD.com without looking at physical stores or seeing other people using it. Now I have it. I can use it for two days, but it charges slowly."
"I’m not very good at playing it yet, but it’s pretty good! The logistics is very fast. I placed the order yesterday and it arrived at noon today. I am very satisfied! ! !"
"It runs fast, and Huawei’s quality is excellent. It’s a good product."
Domestic brands are considered to be relatively good. I believe in Huawei’s products.
Not bad. It's okay to watch a movie
"Things received, the workmanship is OK, the atmosphere supports domestic products, use it first and check it out"
"Original and genuine product. I checked the machine and found that it was the machine on December 12, 2016. I am very satisfied with it. I will try it out before commenting."
"The items are good, but after delivering the items, there is less stuff, and I wasted a day communicating with customer service."
Like Mengniu. @?Jeff is fresh and thick legs
No more Mengniu...Hey...@???_???
My mobile phone broke down 2 months after I bought it. No one else can hear my video conversations. It is definitely not genuine and fake! Report 315
"After looking at it for a long time, I finally made the move. I have been using Huawei products. Cell phones, computers. Support domestic brands."
I just bought it and it's stuck. It's very bad.
"Yes, delivery, the screen is clear. The waiter has a good attitude. . . Not bad, let’s use it first, right?"
I have never seen Mengniu with this pattern. It looks so good~
"Not bad, the response is okay, the price fluctuates greatly"
Why does the screen feel yellow? I feel like this screen doesn’t work!
Does Mengniu’s mobile phone look good?
It’s fast and looks good. I’ll comment after using it.
Mengniu is also used in this tutorial!
Mengniu launches banana-flavored milk that tastes good (>^?^<) Meow
"The charging head broke within a week, and the power button is the same as my previous Honor 6, which is very easy to break! I feel like it’s not worth the price. I’d just pay more and get a mini 4."
"This store sells fake mobile phones, the 4000 mAh battery is so weak. Very disappointed with JD.com"
It’s a very good gift for my mother-in-law. It’s economical and practical. JD.com shipped it super fast. I received it on the same day. Thank you.
"I only reviewed it after using it for a day. I like it very much. It is easy to use, very smooth, and very good."
"The box was crushed, but the phone seems to be usable. I don’t know if it has any effect."
"When the goods arrived, I found that there were no headphones. This is the first time I heard that headphones are not provided when buying a mobile phone. Bad review."
"I have used Huawei mobile phones, and this one really feels like a Huawei phone. It should be genuine, so there is no need to test it! It's pretty good to use, it's smooth and clear. Although it's a product from two years ago, it's really good!"
"A terrible online shopping experience, wow!"
It fits nicely in your hand and is much more comfortable than playing games and watching TV shows on your phone.
"Not bad, I like it very much, easy to use, Huawei is worth owning"
The electrical board is not durable and is a bit stuck.
It sucks. My phone is stuck and I can’t even answer the phone.
"It’s not good. The workmanship is not good. The back has a clear fit and a hollow feeling. I want to return it, but Huawei customer service won’t return it. In short, there are various reasons."
"This is not the first time I bought it, you know"
I received the product but haven’t used it yet. I’ll add a review after using it.
Mengniu's children's food is always powerful. .
Mengniu has become really bad recently. I am completely disappointed with Mengniu. I drink Ningbo milk together. Or I drink Ningbo milk and boycott Mengniu. There is a reason. I haven’t drank it for a long time.
Never drink Mengniu again
"This is my first time placing an order on JD.com, and the service is great! Ordered last night, arrived today! Moreover, the logistics update is super fast, each step is only displayed, and even the whereabouts of the courier brother are provided by GPS! In this regard, Jingdong is super cute!"
"Thank you dad for bringing me Mengniu’s new product, it’s delicious~ I love Mengniu so much, and dad, I love you too~>3< #Camera360PhotoSharing#"
I am very unhappy with this purchase. The tablet is very poor. It doesn’t even have a film. It only has a charger. Why don’t you even give me the charger?
I just got it and after trying it out it was quite smooth. Praise ~
"The machine is okay, but the power bank was delivered the next day. I haven’t enjoyed the discounts from the previous few days, so I feel like I’ve made a huge loss."
I can’t watch Youku and can’t download the video plug-in. It’s rubbish.
"This product is not good. It keeps crashing after only using it for a few days. When it crashes, I don’t know where to fix it. It’s so annoying."
The card slot is really difficult to take out. The card removal pin is not well designed and is too straight and slippery. Everything else is quite satisfactory.
"Mengniu, you are so shameless!"
"Bought this for my mom, she likes it very much, it’s beautiful and classy"
"Bad review, the power button and volume button are very loose. Is this a refurbished machine?"
"The performance of the tablet is pretty good, the sound quality is pretty good, and the delivery is pretty fast, but I really can’t compliment the delivery packaging..."
The cows in Mengniu Cattle Farm are very powerful. I like this song more and more. Repost on Weibo.
It runs fast and plays Honor of Kings without lag. It’s very easy to use.
"This is good for watching TV and playing Honor of Kings, but sometimes it gets a little stuck. The memory is cleaned in time, but it is not bad, and various learning software can be installed. Just the resolution is a bit low."
"It’s easy to use, the internet speed is very fast, and it’s convenient for typing. I hope I’ll buy it again next time. This is my second purchase."
"The packaging is average, the outer packaging is large, the outer packaging of the tablet itself is small, and the tablet dances happily inside."
"Guangming Beiyou's fresh milk is the best, Mengniu's pure milk is second, and Yili's is too inferior. Mengniu"
"It’s not easy to use, the memory is small, and the on/off key settings often touch the lock screen. It’s troublesome, and it’s too heavy."
"Mengniu sells a large bottle of yakurt, and it tastes pretty good!"
Cheating Mengniu. . . I stopped drinking it a long time ago. Mengniu is really a very unscrupulous company. I will never buy anything from Mengniu again! You should drink less domestic milk!
"The hardware is fairly balanced, the screen is good, and the sound is okay, but..."
"Mengniu is not planned, but built on solid products, services and systems. The best models are often the simplest things."
"I bought it for my children. I was worried that there would be no signal and I bought it with full network access. The children like it very much. This product is good, good, good, good."
"Things are fine, but talking is like farting"
"I bought it for my child, and he likes it very much, but there is one drawback: the pixels are too poor! !"
Jingdong is fast and the stuff is very good
I bought it for playing games. I don’t have to choose a screen. The performance is also very good. I support Huawei and domestic products.
"I will never drink Mengniu Yili yogurt again, it tastes so bad @"
I just bought it and don’t even have headphones.
"They said they would give you an invoice, but they said they had already sent it when they didn't receive it. There was no proof, so it's my fault. This is not the first time that JD.com has refused to issue an invoice. I admit my mistake and will buy from JD.com next time. After all, they are already the best, so I can only be a bitch!"
Very rubbish! It’s clear that the quality is not good but you still don’t admit it. It’s a loss for me but I still come to support domestic products.
Never drink Mengniu Yili
It took me a while to evaluate it. The size is suitable for people who often go out. The appearance and materials are very good. Huawei’s performance is excellent. I will continue to support domestic products. come on
"If you don’t drink Mengniu, don’t eat Shuanghui. The cartoon is not bad."
"Things are so-so, the screen is too big"
"As strong and bright as Mengniu, it has not stopped this year."
"Things are good, very satisfied"
"I bought it on sale, the price is affordable, and it works well."
"Very useful, Huawei, China is promising, pride of Made in China"
"It's really easy to use. Huawei's quality is great, the workmanship is very fine, and the delivery is fast. It's really good."
"I posted a message on Weibo to express my love for Youyi C, and was thanked by Mengniu customer service. Mengniu is awesome!"
"I have been using the tablet for a day and it feels pretty good. However, some apps are inconvenient to download and are not available in the Huawei App Store. You have to download them from other channels."
The goods are shipped very well and the express delivery is also very fast. The service attitude is very good. It has not been installed yet. I will have time to install it in a few days.
"It’s not easy to use, the screen is not sensitive, the signal is garbage, and it’s inconvenient to use."
"There is no film, so I suggest the merchant give one as a gift. Also, the tailing is really obvious, so it should be that the optimization solution is not good enough. In fact, Apple mainly does a good job in optimization, and there is nothing else to say. It depends on your preference."
The machine is average and the after-sales service is quite satisfactory! !
Mengniu is such a disappointment.
Mengniu is really good~ Let’s head to the ranch now!
"It doesn’t feel very good. I just use it to learn to watch videos, picture documents, etc. Who knew that it is so difficult to connect to cmccweb, and it still can’t be connected, which makes me, a person studying in the classroom, very uncomfortable?"
"The packaging looks okay, but there are no gifts. After using it for one night, the computer freezes seven or eight times, which makes me depressed?(°A°`)?"
"It's okay, it's so easy to use. I always like this."
"Personally, I still like this tablet very much. Used 32 memory cards on it. I think it’s still worth it and I recommend everyone to buy it."
"The service is very poor. Before buying, the customer service responded very promptly. After payment, the customer service reply will be 3 days later. The price reduction is also very impressive."
"After using it for less than two months, the volume button is broken. I am very disappointed. When watching Youku, the screen becomes blurry when I flip the screen several times."
"It's fast, really good, and worth the price."
"Although I have never supported the Mengniu brand, Youyi c tastes pretty good~~"
"It took me a few days to evaluate it. It’s good and very clear, but I need headphones for calls."
"It's good to use, it's good to give it as a gift."
Mengniu is so wicked!
"It’s rubbish, the pixels are not good, and it’s a bit laggy. The key is that all applications need to be updated, including the system. Just updating it is crazy. It’s rubbish for tablets, rubbish for Huawei, and rubbish for JD.com. I’ll never buy anything from JD.com again."
I found out that it was a used product that had been returned! Very disappointed! Really disappointed. It’s so unethical to send someone else’s returned goods to me!
This is the first time I bought a mobile phone from JD.com. It’s very easy to use. Thank you to the seller. I like it very much. Take a look at the pictures.
"The delivery is fast, the machine is beautiful, the sound is surround, and the screen display is gorgeous. It’s very good."
"This machine has serious smear, so it's not worth buying. I bought it for a friend, and he didn't mind much, so I won't return it."
"Cost-effective, not amazing but good value for money, not comparable to iPad but I think it’s worth the price"
I love tablets. This is my first time buying a Huawei product. It’s really good. I’m really proud of being a domestic brand. I support domestic products. There’s nothing wrong with it! ! ! ! !
"Less than half a month after purchase, the price was reduced by 300, but the application for price protection failed. The reason was that there was a gift. It is recommended that everyone cancel the gift when buying something."
"Anyway, I refuse Mengniu and I won’t drink Mengniu."
The quality is very good and runs smoothly. All good. Very satisfied.
"With a slight flick, the screen shattered. I will not buy Huawei products in the future. I really can’t."
Why doesn’t it come with a protective film or headphones?
I have been using it for more than a month and it feels good. I often use WeChat and it is so smooth so far.
"The phone is very good, very powerful and runs very fast when using it."
The tablet looks good and is very fast. Children like it very much.
"It’s very laggy when playing, but it’s okay to play mobile games with it."
The machine has become curved after two days of use. Will it become more and more curved? ? ?
"I feel like vomiting when I see Yili, I faint when I see Mengniu, I get angry when I see Wong Lo Kat!"
"Nothing to say, I often don’t receive calls. . . Why. . That's rubbish. . ."
It's so bad that it doesn't even have a film to deceive people. It's cheap but not good.
"It looks beautiful, has a clear screen, and runs smoothly after connecting to wifi. The only drawback is that the battery is not durable."
"I'm really not very satisfied. The workmanship of the product is very poor, the screen frame is blistered, and the paint peeled off within a month of using it. It's so rubbish that I don't even want to give it a bad review."
"It's okay, worth buying, and worth the money."
"I have always supported domestic products, and Huawei is still very reliable."
The quality was so bad that it was repaired just two months ago and it cost *
Probably no one remembers the gentle little Mengniu Niuniu.
"Reply: Internet crisis public relations is very good, I hope the quality can be the same. I assure you, Mengniu is still delicious."
"Bad review, no headphones included"
The phone crashed twice in less than a month after I bought it. I don’t know what to do if I don’t have a battery.
"The real thing is good, and the speed is also 66. The only shortcoming is that it does not come with a protective film and earphones. I always feel that something is missing?_?"
"Very good, I keep buying it, especially this time, the price is great and the express delivery is good, I will always buy things on JD.com!"
"I have bought hundreds of thousands of items on JD.com, and this is the first time I have given a negative review."
"Are you sure I bought Full Netcom? It’s obviously mobile, so disappointing"
"Smart and beautiful Mengniu children's shoes, I wish you a happy birthday! @Spring_?????"
"I bought it for my dad, so I can use it to watch movies and buy what I like. It’s very cost-effective."
The screen shows that it is OK to watch videos. The application is a mobile version and there are glitches when placed in the corners.
It's all malicious advertising
"There was almost no response when touching the edge of the screen. At first I thought it was a software problem, but later I found out it was a problem with the screen, and it didn’t support multi-touch. The product experience was too poor, and it was a very failed purchase."
"Totally bad review. After only using it for a few days, the camera freezes, the photos are poor, and the video screen is even worse."
"It’s the festival. In addition to moon cakes, hairy crabs, various fruits, etc., there are also countless gifts from Mengniu and Yili. Should I drink it? Should I drink it? Can I drink it? Can I drink it? Can I drink it?"
"Very good product, this is already the fifth one. Bought with a friend"
"Since Guangming's ""True Truth"", Mengniu has not been outdone. Chun Zhen tastes pretty good."
"The stuff is nice and bright. The speed is unbelievable. I don’t know if it can maintain this speed after using it for a while. Let’s see. come on. You can access the Internet by inserting a telecommunications card, but it's not easy to make phone calls."
"The tablet is beautiful, non-slip, fast enough, and the size is right"
"Kiwi: I like Mengniu’s drinks with kiwi flavor, juice with kiwi flavor, kiwi slices, and kiwi itself. . . . Before the day before yesterday, I never knew that I liked kiwi fruit"
"This tablet has too many pre-installed software and cannot be flashed, so it is easy to be infected. I'm so depressed!"
Jingdong’s self-operated ones are okay
"Huawei mobile phones and tablets are great value for money. The call sound quality is very good, the application runs smoothly, the screen is large for watching videos, playing games, and surfing the Internet very fast. I am very satisfied!"
"Used to read e-books, the picture is clear and fast, it’s fun"
"The appearance is okay, the battery is like an old one, it is fully charged, and it runs out of power in a very short time without using the phone."
"The machine is stuck, the picture quality is unclear, the screen resolution is unclear, and the response is slow."
"I don’t want to give it a single star. It obviously arrived on the 18th but was only delivered on the 21st. I originally applied for a refund, but it was sent to me anyway."
The mobile phone has a large screen and is convenient for watching videos
The size is suitable and the workmanship is good. I hope the system updates can keep up in the future.
"The tablet computer is really good and genuine. Good, good, good, good...! Trust JD.com! ————No invoice."
The machine has been tampered with by someone else! There are fingerprints on the screen! There are scratches! ! ! ! ! ! !
Is Liu Moumou the best Ep? hehe. ridiculous! So disappointed in you! Protect the Diaoyu Islands and reject Mengniu@Mengniu Sour Yoghurt Superstar Dream Academy
"I have been using it for a while, and I feel it runs well, quite smoothly, and the price is cheap."
not bad! Quite cheap. Jingdong delivery is fast!
Fast delivery and awesome
"Big enough, useful enough, good battery life, average workmanship"
"Drinking Mengniu Youyi C gives me a sense of happiness, which comes from memories of childhood. . . Because she has the taste of childhood yogurt, very pure and real. @guangxi eat, drink and have fun"
"It was pretty good at first, but I mainly liked the eye protection mode! It feels very useful!"
"Very beautiful, the sound is very comfortable, the configuration is high, and the delivery is fast."
The courier guy is really awesome! I am currently studying the tablet after receiving it. It feels good and is fast! ! !
"Shopping on JD.com is risky, so consumers should be cautious when spending money. I have learned what it means to not be held responsible for goods shipped out."
Nothing can be said about the Huawei tablet. It is worth buying. It has high configuration and high cost performance. It is worth recommending. Several friends have bought it. Watch videos and play games without any delay.
"Not bad, the sound quality is really good and the operation is relatively smooth."
Not bad and in use
"Fine workmanship, stereo sound effect, and excellent sound quality! Watching video movies on the high-definition screen is quite enjoyable. Support Huawei!"
"I just got it, give me full marks first"
"The most failed purchase, from placing the order to receiving the goods, 16 days, I am speechless."
"The workmanship of Huawei's products is really good, and the metal back has a good texture. But the plastic on the side feels a little low. Bought for an elderly person, the sound is relatively loud. It was okay for the old man to listen."
"The stuff is okay, but the delivery is terrible"
This mobile phone is poor. The response speed is too fast. It is not enough for the elderly. It is not recommended to buy it.
"Logistics is too slow, I don’t know if it’s possible to use a mobile phone!"
SBSB boycotts Mengniu
The screen is large and has an eye protection mode. I bought it for my baby to watch TV. It’s a good deal at this price. The battery is also relatively durable. I’m satisfied.
It's pretty good. It's not bad. I upgraded it when I got it back. It's not bad. I think it's okay so far.
"The logistics is very fast, the screen is clear, and I am using it so far, but the price was reduced just after I bought it."
"It broke down after less than 2 months of use. It couldn't be charged or turned on. I had it repaired once, but it didn't work again after two days at home. Now I'm sending it to a repair center for repair!"
"It's very easy to use, no lag at all, except that the screen feels a bit small, otherwise it's perfect!"
"Very good. I won it at 1580 when it was 618. Fortunately, I didn’t make a move when it was 1900."
Mengniu’s lens should be good!
What I bought today was Mengniu~ not Guangming~
"I haven't used it much since I bought it because I was busy with work. I used it a few times within 20 days. When I first got it, I noticed a slight screen jump. I didn't care about it at the time. I only used it a few times in total and didn't notice it at all."
I haven’t installed it yet. I’ll try it again after using it. It should be good. I’ll give it a thumbs up first.
Not bad~ I’m watching it after using it for a while~
"The phone arrived quickly and looks very beautiful, but the screen is a bit difficult to hold."
"Mengniu from Hong Kong is guaranteed, but do you dare to drink from the Mainland? IQ is a flaw!"
"We like candies, jelly, marshmallows, Wahaha, Shuangwaiwai, Wangzai Milk, Mengniu QQ Star. When will we, who are greedy for snacks, grow up and get rid of the title of ""just kids""?"
"The screen is really big, but unfortunately there is not enough memory, so it feels very slow! ! ! I should buy the eight-inch one from Lenovo!"
It's okay to use. There are no problems so far. Playing games and watching movies is very good.
"Bought this for my nephew, I like it very much"
"JD.com's self-operated machine is also a refurbished one. I'm really convinced. When I opened it, there were traces on the screen. The speaker and the seam of the back cover were obviously loose. It was really annoying. It's a shame that I trusted JD.com's self-operated machine so much. If I had known better. Went to *bought"
It is really a happy thing to watch CBA while eating sweet oranges and Mengniu ice cream.
"Very good, high resolution, good phone"
"The speed is okay, the resolution is not very high. It's okay for doing aerobics. The quality is worthy of the price. Shipping is very fast!"
People don’t believe JD.com when they cheat people with second-hand goods. A mobile phone worth more than 800 yuan still deceives people like this.
"I didn’t get anything as a gift, just a bare phone. I’m so sad!"
"At first, I was asked to upgrade twice, but I only upgraded once. Thank you to customer service Baozhu for your professional and patient answer. Thanks for the three freebies."
"I just grew up drinking Sanlu milk. Oh, what a pity! Missing Sanlu Mengniu has a lot of disgusting things going on, how come it’s still alive?"
I bought it when I was sure about it. This is my first tablet. There is no comparison. I am in the process of upgrading it. I hope it will be useful.
The speed is very fast and supports JD.com. I feel very good after receiving the tablet.
"Bought this for my daughter, she should like it very much! I haven't used it yet, so I don't know how it is. The domestic one should not be too bad. Ask me why I have negative reviews, just to make my presence felt, because there are too many positive reviews!"
"Poor pixels, poor resolution, returned"
This is my second purchase. They are very good.
Very good and beautiful. I like it very much. I will come back next time if I have the chance.
Logistics is too slow
"The stuff is very good. I have always trusted JD.com. I hope JD.com will get better and better, and JD.com’s products will get better and better~"
I placed an order yesterday morning and said it would be delivered in the afternoon. It was delivered the next day. The customer service was useless. I called the courier guy the next day and the price was increased and it was delivered in advance. A terrible purchase. Disappointed.
"There is a small bright spot on the screen, so I returned it."
"It's very good and easy to use. It matches the description and is basically the same as the real thing. I recommend it to my friends and let them buy it too. It's cheap and affordable, much cheaper than in the supermarket."
"Because of enlightenment, it is awesome, so Mengniu was born to harm the stupid Chinese residents."
"I have nothing to say about the fast delivery. After trying it out for a long time, I personally feel that the quality is right for the price. It’s pretty good... a pretty good purchase."
"The color is high-end, the speed is fast, the clarity is very high, the logistics service is very good, and it is definitely worth the money."
"Let more consumers love banana milk, girl, keep working hard! I am very pleased that the banana + organic raw milk imported from Brazil is of course delicious. Tasteful! ! Mengniu is a very good dairy company. Peng Xiao: Thank you for supporting Mengniu products!"
It’s really good. My kids like it very much.
"It's really not that good, I won't buy this anymore. The packaging has been damaged, otherwise it will be returned"
The phone does not dissipate heat well and is very hot. And why is there a black sponge blocking the place where my tablet inserts the phone card?
"Very good, cost-effective, 100 points. I love Huawei products. All electronic products are Huawei."
"These are troubled times. These big brands, Mengniu, Xiujiu Pharmaceutical, and Jiugui Liquor, should all go bankrupt."
quick! It feels okay! Use it to know the effect
"It’s really rubbish. When it arrived, the inner screen was shattered. I sent it back for exchange. The test couldn’t determine who was responsible, so we asked the manufacturer to pay for repairs. It looked good and there were no scratches on the outer screen. How could I tell what the problem was? ?"
"Haven't used it yet, don't know how it works"
I like Huawei very much. JD.com is really fast. I will come back next time.
"The battery life is terrible, far worse than the iapd4 I have been using for two years."
It seems to be a box of Mengniu. You have to be careful. Mengniu has chronic poison and a lot of snacks!
"I won’t say anything else. If the logistics is not good, don’t be confident about next-day delivery, okay? Are all the customer service people from SI? The screen protector included in the after-sales package is unique, where is it? Disappointed, just a 618 made it like this, ugh"
"The price has been reduced by 200 within 10 days of purchase. Dear friends, you need it when buying a mobile phone on JD.com. . . . It’s better to shop at * and at least make up the price difference, but I guess the bad reviews won’t be displayed."
"This is the second time I have purchased one. The first time I bought one for my mother, and this time I bought another one for myself."
Tablet performance is pretty good! Listening to music and watching movies are not bad either! It would be embarrassing to restart a time-travel mobile game
"Worst shopping ever, ever"
".`The stuff is easy to use, the price is affordable, and it has good reviews"
Bought for the kids. Didn't play much
This is the last time and I will never come to JD.com to buy anything again. The service cannot be worse.
"Booting up is very, very, very slow! The pixels are not as low as usual, and the phone starts to get hot after just playing with it for a while! Really not worth the price"
Bought this for my dad and had a great time
"Logistics is super fast, tablet quality is very good"
"This tablet is of good quality and easy to use, I really like it! Very easy to use, fast, big screen, very clear"
"Ordered in the morning and received the goods in the afternoon, JD’s delivery was still fast. I saw that this one is new this year, and the Android 7.0 system should be much easier to use. When I first turned it on, the effect seemed to be good, but I was a little tired of applying the film myself."
"Bought for myself, much better than Apple mobile phone, the price is also right"
"The stuff is good, the quality is very good, Huawei is trustworthy"
The quality is so bad that I had to replace two in a row and still have problems.
The running speed is very good!
The baby has been received. The quality is great. The baby is learning well. The delivery speed is very fast. The delivery person has a very good service attitude and is very responsible. It is a very satisfying purchase.
The screen has low pixels and is not very clear. I regret buying it.
"There were two scratches on the tablet when I bought it, and the tempered film was the worst I have ever bought, with two scratches. The packaging is as shown in the picture, and there is no padding at all. The worst shopping experience, please think twice before buying."
"As soon as I bought it, I felt it was obviously bent."
"Mengniu has experienced so many things and still has a large number of loyal consumers, thanks to its packaging designers. . . As someone who has never bought his products, I was attracted by its packaging today and bought a can. . ."
"I bought it for my family, and I'm still learning to use it. The camera effect is not as good as that of a mobile phone with the same pixels."
"The product is easy to use, practical and durable. Worth a thumbs up!"
"Okay, okay, okay, okay. The five stars below are for the courier guy"
What? The phone doesn’t have headphones and the screen doesn’t have a film. It really makes me angry.
"This is the first time I gave JD one star, and I’m really angry!"
Baby is fine! !
"Unfortunately, the package was damaged when I received it. The package contained a tablet, a Blackmi mobile card, an invoice, and a JD.com advertisement. However, there was no Changdu card or Tencent video card. I am currently consulting customer service. . . . . . ."
It’s not cheap to buy on Double 11. The price dropped the day after I bought it.
"Don’t forget to bully me even when driving, Mengniu plus Yili!"
"I really think the packaging box of Mengniu is very small, fresh and cute. I love it so much. I used to like to drink high-quality yogurt but not pure milk. Now I particularly like pure milk. Can anyone tell me why I don’t drink a pound of milk every day to make China stronger? people"
I haven’t drank Mengniu for a long time because the milk is no longer white!
Festival fucking is very powerful. Just use this for Mengniu’s slogan.
A good tablet at a good price.
"What about the one who promised to send stickers? Didn't see it, dizzy..."
"I bought it for my dad. It’s pretty good and lightweight, and the delivery was super fast."
"Dummy battery, crappy UI, big black border, black unicorn, low cost."
"Bought for a friend and sent EMS, it was extremely slow and the logistics information obtained was wrong. Bad review."
"I used to treat you to Mengniu, but now I treat you to KFC and Mengniu! ! If you don’t believe it, you’re still alive! !"
"I bought it for an event. It’s pretty good for now, but playing Honor of Kings is not as smooth as a mobile phone. I don’t know if there’s something wrong with the settings. I’ll try it again later. Overall, it feels good. I’ll add more in the future."
Send nothing. Businessmen are too stingy
"It looks very beautiful, is very light in hand, and the system runs very smoothly. Playing games is awesome! The price/performance ratio of a tablet in this price range is really very good! Worth buying!"
"The battery is too rubbish. It runs out of power after half a day of use. It also runs laggy and automatically shuts down. The price is not cheap. It is my first time using Huawei. To be honest, I also want to support domestic products, but Huawei makes me sad!"
Things are very good! ! ! !
I like the milk made by demom
"The response is a bit slow. As an old Huawei user, I don’t feel Huawei’s progress."
Could the murderer be Mengniu?
"The fitness is not bad, but it lacks a certain taste bud-stimulating presence. Mengniu Xiaojian is very effective. I have bought it twice in a row. I hope I will buy it a third time."
"Definitely not recommended to buy it. Just a week after buying it, I accidentally dropped it while wearing the Pad case and the monitor was scrapped. The quality is not average! Made of tofu!"
It’s still very good to use so far.
The sound is very powerful.
It's far worse than expected... It's still so expensive. I would have bought Xiaomi if I had known it. The resolution is so low.
"I have used it for a few days to review. The speed is good and the screen is clear enough. Huawei's is worth using, and I feel better than Apple's. The proportion is suitable for office reading and PPT."
"I've tried Yili's Whiskey, and it's good for my feet. Yesterday you went to the supermarket and found that Mengniu also sells the same type of product. I forgot the name. It costs 5 yuan a box, and Yili's 3.8. . I didn’t buy it, but I bought a Vicozi~~"
"The first time I went shopping on JD.com, I had a very, very unforgettable experience. I don’t think I will buy anything here next time. I’m really speechless. It’s so bad."
"It's good to buy for children to play games, but it's a bit troublesome to listen to the phone because it's big and hard to hold."
"It's good, but there are no gifts"
"The most successful advertising planning and copywriting, Mengniu has mastered the key after many years. While in opposition, he spoke many truths."
"Bought for my sons, it’s okay."
"Bullshit, boycott Mengniu!"
I placed an order last night and received it. I already bought one. It’s ok -
"The quality is very good, the workmanship is fine, the system is smooth, the standby time is OK, and there is no lag. Huawei's products are indeed good, and JD.com's after-sales service is, needless to say, top-notch."
"I have consulted customer service several times, but every time I was ignored and could not solve the problem."
The resolution is too low! ! !
"Help, it’s just as expected, give it a like"
"Negative reviews are not bad reviews, they are mainly for people who want to buy now."
"Not bad. I originally wanted to buy a cheap one and use it casually. I didn’t expect to be able to watch videos. After buying it, I found that the videos are actually quite clear. It’s not bad. I only commented after using it for a long time. There is no problem. It’s good."
"The item is good and can be delivered by express delivery. I just received it and after tinkering with it, there is no problem. The machine is quite beautiful. I hope there is no problem."
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
"A very pleasant shopping, no lag at all????"
Logistics is fast. I haven’t used it yet. I won’t be disappointed.
Cheap and good quality
The baby has been received. The packaging is tight and the quality is very good. The screen is large and easy to use. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Good reviews.
"Nowadays, Huawei's products are still very good and easy to use."
"Not bad, for kids"
"Just received it, it feels good, very good. I don’t know if the quality is satisfactory, I haven’t started using it yet."
"Big screen, powerful battery"
", I have been uneasy recently, so I will first fulfill my little wish. Just come and have a full banquet. Give me a cup of hot milk before going to bed. If you don’t want to drink Yili, don’t drink Mengniu. Nestlé will do. Then we both started complaining until dawn"
It’s so unreliable. Mengniu is always the one who gets hacked. Yili must have done it~
Waiting for Mengniu to collapse.
The Huawei I have been using is a good machine and supports domestic products.
"Except for the abnormal noise coming from the charger, everything else is normal. Still worth buying"
"Overall it's good, but the middle of the screen seems to be pressable and it doesn't affect the use. I'm too lazy to change it. Huawei's quality control needs to be strengthened."
"The quality is good, that is to say, there are no good gifts. When the gifts are finished, it is written on it. Others have it, but I don't. When I submit the order, it shows that it is, but when I receive the goods, there are no gifts. What does it mean to give away gifts while supplies last."
"Bad quality, don’t like it!"
"Very good, very powerful, very beautiful, support domestic products!"
"Jingdong's after-sales service is very good. If there is a problem with the item, it will be replaced with a new one. It is currently being tried. The specific situation will be submitted later."
"The water heater is good. I will have hot water for future use, which is convenient. The delivery was very fast. It is worth mentioning that the delivery man helped me change the delivery time according to the agreement. Later, when I called to ask for delivery, it was delivered in time. Thank you."
Is there something wrong with Mengniu Deluxe? I get diarrhea every time I drink other brands of milk and it’s fine~
I just bought 2049 on March 8th. I will do an activity on March 10th for 1899. I feel uncomfortable. ?
"Bought for a friend, he is very satisfied"
"To be honest, I'm very doubtful. The phone doesn't have a plastic seal. This is directly wrong."
Not good. This product is very slow and stuck. The quality is not good at all. The service attitude is not good.
The stuff is good and can meet office needs!
"It’s a little inappropriate to compare this to Apple, after all, the quality is definitely different if the price is different. Give it four stars, lest they get too proud. Ha ha"
"The company gave out four bottles of milk and an apple as Christmas gifts. If Apple thinks this is safe, then Mengniu thinks, does it want us to farm like cows? Ha ha"
It’s not that great. I often can’t exit and it’s a bit stuck. The heat dissipation is not very good. I feel like I’ve been cheated.
"#give me a fulcrum, I can lift the whole piece and cut the cake# Should Mengniu’s slogan be changed to not the most deceptive but only the more deceitful? If you dare to blackmail yourself, don’t delete Weibo"
Did you drink too much Mengniu this morning?
"Yes, yes, so-so, so-so, so-so"
The black edges are too disgusting and sometimes get stuck!
"The boot time is too long, the Internet response is slow, and the video always freezes."
"Bad review, bad review, the price will be reduced after buying it, and you can't make up the difference...Bad review, bad review ?_?"
That’s disgusting. Is Mengniu okay?
"It's very easy to use, has powerful functions, and I'm very satisfied with the size. I believe in Huawei's quality. Now the price is cheaper again, but it’s a pity that I bought it too early!"
Mengniu is stupid
"The product stopped charging within a month. When I took it for a checkup, it was said that the motherboard was broken and no card had been installed."
You can call me and buy it for a friend. My friend said it works very well.
"The stuff is good, I really like it."
"JD.com's logistics is fast enough, and the delivery boy's attitude is also good. The tablet is very good to use, the screen is very clear, and it is smooth to use."
I bought the same Huawei Honor x2 last year. I trust Huawei and JD.com.
"The response is a bit slow, but everything else is okay."
I just received the tablet. It feels great when I open it and use it. It supports domestic products.
The brand is very powerful
"Yes, it is very clear that there is no gift, only a protective film, and the leather case has to be purchased by yourself!"
"The price was reduced as soon as I placed the order, which is uncomfortable."
Mengniu is sorry
"Bought for a friend, got good reviews"
"The Honor 2 tablet can be used, the speed is relatively smooth, and no problems have been found so far. The entertainment and games are good, and the screen is good in all aspects."
The delivery and everything were very fast. The screen is too fragile. It broke after being charged. It has only been used for less than a month. Repairs are difficult and I am speechless!
Shipping was fast. Just received it. It works well.
"The coupon was not used, so I canceled the order, but the cancellation was not successful. Forget it, the price was reduced after I bought it. I’m so angry!"
I placed the order yesterday and received the product today. I feel the size is just right. I haven’t found any problems yet. I will review it after using it for a while.
"If there was a discrepancy in the address, I contacted customer service in time and they solved it successfully. Thank you. The tablet is okay, it’s okay for daily use, and Honor of Kings isn’t that laggy either."
"It’s only been a month since I bought it! The flat shell is cracked everywhere! Friends, watch and buy it!"
Not as good as expected
"The screen is big, my husband likes it very much"
"It broke half a month after I got it, and it took me a month to repair it."
Mengniu red bean ice cream tastes pretty good~~~
The resolution of the tablet is terrible! It doesn't work even if I apply for an exchange. It says it has been unpacked. Can I still see the low resolution if I don't unpack it? Laughing to death!
"I wanted to support domestically produced ones, but they were difficult to use, especially the smart keys, which were uncomfortable to use. The response was also quite slow, which I regret. . . ."
"The battery didn’t work, but the seller didn’t care about the problem and said it was normal."
"Bad review, too lazy to return it. Pixel is really not an ordinary scumbag."
"Not installed yet, I will comment after installation."
"I thought that there was a problem with IBM's public relations. The result of not even a single scandal was that internal corruption became increasingly serious, just like Mengniu today. The media has lost the supervision and restraint it should have."
"The charger was broken when the item was sent, and the customer service kept nagging me, which is really annoying!"
"I'm using it now, there's no big problem, it's OK, and it's cost-effective"
Mengniu must be boycotted
The battery I just bought is not durable...
"The sound effects are okay, but the photography is a bit shabby. I sent a film, but it hasn’t been applied yet. The logistics is very fast."
"My phone is really bad, it's stuck all the time"
The world is unanimously restricting milk exports to the mainland. Don't Mengniu and Yili feel ashamed? ? ?
"Mengniu, how can I accept you? It’s terrible. “The production date of 3,000 boxes of Mengniu milk that was about to expire was tampered with” (from http:t.cn/zWRpZYf"
This is my second time here. This electric water heater is really good.
JD Express in Xiangyang is too slow...too slow! (It took 4 days to arrive) No answer when I called the contact number...! Such service..... treated as TCL (too bad)!
"Excellent product and customer service that knows nothing about it, a perfect match!"
Throw it in the trash can
"Already returned it, too much pre-installed software. They are all Huawei software and some software that are not useful at all. Too bad."
I have been using it for almost a month. The quality is good and it runs smoothly.
The stuff is pretty good. It’s enough for one person to wash.
"It’s cheaper after buying it, bad review"
"I speak with conscience. After using it for a few days, I feel that the touch response is indeed not sensitive, and the screen often freezes. The screen color is acceptable and acceptable. I personally think it is just fine for use. I do not recommend buying it."
I can’t buy it. It’s too bad. I regret it. It’s cheap but not good. The main reason is that the pigment is too bad.
It was just delivered in the morning and the price was reduced by 300 in the evening.
"Just a bare metal and charger, no other small items"
"The tablet is good, the configuration is quite high, it is very smooth to use, the 2K screen is very clear, and the photography is also good."
Can't insert mobile phone card and it's hard to use
It can only be charged using the configured Type-C cable and cannot read or write data such as address books. Some functions are hidden and difficult to use.
I sent a lot of things that are very useful and support Huawei.
"It's crap, it won't turn on after just a few uses, don't buy it if you haven't bought it yet, you've been seriously cheated. Super bad! ! ! Full of anger"
"The system cannot be updated and upgraded, the memory is too small, the resolution is too poor, the pixels are low, the appearance is as low as the sewer...all kinds of bad things! This star is for the card slot."
"The system is smooth and the phone is from Huawei, so it is easy to use."
"Very good, a good shopping trip"
I’ve been using it for a few days and it’s very smooth. The emui5.0 system upgrade I pushed yesterday is great.
"My dad uses it, it’s pretty good, it should be genuine."
"The sound effect is good, thank you courier guy."
"The biggest problem is that when the auto-rotate button is turned on, games and video apps cannot automatically rotate and can only be displayed vertically. It didn't work after reinstalling several times."
"I have bought this phone for 5 colleagues, all of whom are middle-aged and elderly people. The giant screen phone is very suitable for them."
"The express delivery is also very fast, the packaging is rigorous, the tablet is good, the battery is estimated to last four to five hours for watching TV, and it takes three to four hours to fully charge. I don’t remember the specific time. There are no task problems so far."
Doesn’t Mengniu feel ashamed? !
"Now for the evaluation, the color of the tablet screen is wrong. The whole screen is only yellow and green. It is garbage."
"The stickers provided are not good at all, so sad! It's all bubbles."
Slow response and unclear screen
"There are fine scratches on the back cover, and there are many small lines on the corners of the trademark. It can be inferred that this machine may be a prototype or has been tried many times by others."
"I wish every time I bought something, it would be available in my area."
good
"Very good, you deserve it!"
"The M3 tablet did not disappoint me. The sound quality has been significantly improved regardless of the low-resolution configuration. Reading books and watching TV shows is so enjoyable, but it shouldn’t be without OTG! ! !"
"The delivery speed is quite fast, but the resolution of the phone is a bit poor and it gets a bit hot when charging."
"The built-in sound and video files playback is very good, the image is clear and the sound is loud. Overall, I am satisfied."
"You can also make do with foreign wine, please have a barrel. You can also make do with foreign wine, please. Please agree. You can also make do with it. Please, oh, good, good, good."
Jingdong’s service is very good. The tablet is very powerful and very fast!
"First, the clarity is not enough and the response is not sensitive. Second, the fried chicken screen is not clear and blurry. Third, the price will be reduced after buying it, so angry! ! !"
"Good stuff, awesome"
I bought the wrong one and couldn’t use my card; I regretted it.
Drinking more Mengniu will help you sleep more peacefully!
Mengniu’s new packaging looks quite fresh.
It’s been a long time since I received the phone before I reviewed it. It’s very easy to use and large. I give it full marks.
I think it's okay. I waited so long to buy it. I checked it and it's genuine.
"Not bad, the picture is clear. It’s good for kids to learn English."
"Waiting for the handoff, waiting for the handoff, the models were impatient and drank coffee, so a group of us came here to have fun~~ What a great help! There is also Mengniu Big Fruit Fruit to drink, it’s so awesome! Following Brother Long, he made many mistakes in his childhood!"
Not bad. The price is very affordable. The quality is very good. Please give it a thumbs up.
Mengniu’s new product tastes great
Beibei loves to be clean. She takes a shower every day when she goes out. She also likes to drink Mengniu. She doesn’t like to squat. She likes to sit on a stool and likes to sit with me~
"Good, it runs fast and the sound quality is good. It meets my requirements very well. I will continue to support domestic products! ?"
Believe in Huawei's quality. This 16:9 screen looks comfortable and is comfortable to hold. The colors are bright and the touch screen is relatively sensitive. It's a great gift to give away.
It looks pretty good. I bought it for an old man. It should be okay. I haven’t heard of it.
"The letters are big, and the old man holds them very well."
"Fortunately, the call quality is not very good, there is echo, and the Internet is laggy, which is quite uncomfortable."
"Personally, I think the Huawei tablet is really good and its performance is very good! JD.com’s delivery is super fast. I got up early to place the order and received it at noon!"
"I also miss the bilingual late-night snacks. At that time, I loved the Mengniu strawberry flavor @Is it Dragon Brother or Breast Augmentation?"
I just bought something and the courier delivered it to the wrong place. Everything was taken apart. I’m very disappointed.
"I bought it for someone else. So far, it’s good. I’ve always been a fan of Huawei. The delivery is super fast. JD Logistics has nothing to say about it."
"Good quality and cheap, as good as always"
"The speed of the large screen is pretty good, and it is cost-effective. It is very suitable for the elderly. Huawei deserves to be the number one brand in China, and the products are good! Xiaomi, Meizu, etc. are much worse than him! You'll know once you use it."
"It's very good to use, the response is okay, there is no lag, and the overall performance is good."
I’ve had it for a week and I’m still satisfied. I’ve been using Huawei phones and tablets.
The speed is quite fast. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The screen is too big and it is fun to watch movies.
"It feels quite high-end. I'm waiting for the case and membrane, but I don't want to use the membrane that was given. ."
"It supports domestic products, has good performance, is suitable for children to play with, has a suitable size and a beautiful screen. Worth buying."
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good"
Not bad. Our brothers bought 3 of them. They feel good and play games without lag.
"The battery life is quite satisfactory. You can watch live broadcasts and online movies, browse apps, etc. through Wi-Fi. The volume and brightness are medium, and it can last for more than eight hours. The 0-100% charging time is about 4 hours."
"#CCTVFinanceNationalDaySpecial Issue# Mengniu cheese was exposed to illegal additions of milk mineral salts. Mengniu NULL-1 ""milk mineral salts"" controversy continues to spread. Mengniu Children's Growth Cheese was exposed to illegal additions... http:t.cn/zlIDnOi"
I bought it as a gift for my father on Father's Day. The old man is very happy and is learning to use it. good. Very good to use.
"Not satisfied, why are they all in English and there is no instruction manual on how to use it?"
"The negative review is for the LeTV Dimension Card given as a gift, as shown in the picture. I bought it in April. The activation deadline for the card you received from JD.com is March 31, 2017. hehe"
I bought it for my father-in-law. It’s pretty good.
"Overall, it feels good. Huawei's reputation is still good. The battery and storage of the tablet are worthy of praise."
"The device has a micro card and is for parents to use. It still works. I didn’t expect 3G to run like this, especially Dianfangxingjian. It freezes every time. Xiaomi struggles with it. I feel like I made the wrong choice."
Bah! Boycott Mengniu!
Mengniu is becoming safer and better. COFCO and Europe's largest dairy company Array have acquired Mengniu. Milk source and quality control will be further strengthened. I hope to restore your confidence in domestic milk and Mengniu.
"Good attitude, but the resolution is still a bit low."
"It’s really okay, it’s really good"
"It's garbage. When I got it back, I saw that the box had been opened. There was no invoice, no headphones, and no invoice. I didn't want to give a single cent!"
"The tablet is pretty good, but what I have to complain about is the packaging. The carton is not as big as the tablet and it’s still stuffed into it!"
"There is no screen film; the signal is very poor; the system has too many useless software; although the screen is large, the video is not clear at all; the photos and videos are not clear; forget it, it is not good to say too much."
The goods were received quickly. I feel very good after using the product. Watching videos and surfing the Internet are very smooth! Like! !
"Looking forward to Mengniu’s endorsement, each viewer will receive a box of chemical products"
Just got it. The packaging is pretty good and the stuff is very good.
"The screen of the mobile phone was damaged when I received it. It had dozens of scratches. What happened if it was not worth it? The express delivery didn't even have a bubble, so I didn't want to return it. It would cost me 10 yuan to return it. There isn't even an instruction manual."
"The board I just returned has been unable to log into my Huawei account. When I asked customer service, I pushed the problem to the telephone customer service. Then I closed the customer service window and could not open it again! JD.com and Huawei disappoint me so much!"
"Anyway, I don’t drink Mengniu."
How can the transaction be completed without receiving the goods? ? ? ? ?
Reply: It’s Ha Yili’s. Mengniu doesn’t dare to drink it anymore. What kind of milk is it?
The machine is very beautiful and has been verified to be a real machine. JD.com’s products are genuine and the logistics speed is fast. I am very satisfied with the service. I give JD.com a thumbs up.
Don’t worry. Da Mengniu can award the most popular overseas newcomer group or something. My sister also wants to see you.
The price dropped just a few days after I bought it. I’m so excited! ! ! JD.com. . . . Deduct three stars from you
I bought this one for my dad. The resolution is so low and it looks low-end. Any other thousand-yuan camera is better than this one.
"Placed the order for a friend, the service was good, thumbs up"
"It is cost-effective, after all, Huawei is also a famous domestic brand."
"Very practical, my son likes it very much, a good brand is trustworthy."
"What the hell? Others get a leather case when they buy it, but I don’t get one when I buy it? Isn’t this a lie? Bad store!"
The resolution is so rubbish that I regret buying it.
"The automatic horizontal and vertical screens of a certain company are always messed up, bad review"
I feel great!
"This tablet is really good, give it a thumbs up"
My mother said that drinking more Mengniu Guanyi milk is helpful for losing weight.
"If you become a black account inexplicably and cannot receive coupons, you should uninstall the APP immediately, cancel your account, and say never to JD.com in the future. Get out! ! ! ! ! ! !"
"It's pretty good. Although the resolution is not high, it's as expected. Everything else is pretty good. I plan to play games for my dad."
"If you want to be able to make phone calls and check the version clearly before buying, ugh. Very speechless!"
"Very useful, very good, I like it very much"
I want to return a product. How can I return it? It’s so good. I can’t install a phone card. I can only watch TV.
"4G is running in my hand and nothing is turned on, only 2.3G. The memory is even more disgusting. It freezes when there are too many people playing Naruto. To be honest, it is definitely not worth the price. *The last time I bought Huawei, apart from the good logistics, there is nothing better."
It’s just a bare machine with nothing. I’m a little dissatisfied.
I have received the goods. The courier delivered it quickly without being affected by the weather. I feel good after using it for a day and the speed is very fast.
The baby has been received. I think it’s okay. I’ll leave a review after using it.
"Damn it, it's so stuck"
"The first time I bought it, there was dust in the screen. I returned it and bought a new one. The second time, there was still a screen. Fortunately, it was smaller than the last one. I was too lazy to return it, but the good reviews were gone."
Not bad. I bought it for my dad to watch TV. It’s enough.
"It looks okay, but the buttons are too loose and make noise when touched. I don’t know whether the screen is too sensitive or too insensitive. Sometimes I don’t touch it and I get to the next page. Sometimes I press it several times and it doesn’t move. I want to buy an iPad if I have money. Bar"
"It’s okay, but the power bank I promised was not delivered, so bad review"
"The garbage machine often has a black screen, which is frustrating."
This membrane is absolutely rubbish. I’m totally sorry for the price.
This is a gift for my mother so that she can watch the TV series and the functions are available...
Today's yogurt has a strange smell. I will never buy Mengniu again. Australian yogurt is too thick.
uncomfortable. Have loose bowels. Still have a low fever. I just drank a bottle of Mengniu. Not like this.
"Except for the unnecessary wide black border, it's basically perfect. I bought it for 618 for 988, which is more cost-effective than the current M3. What's more, Huawei's original protective case only has half of it!"
"Mengniu, green mood. I really like green more and more"
"No, it’s so stuck, and the Internet speed is so slow. I feel like I’ve been cheated."
The phone has a big screen and is great for playing games. Logistics is super fast.
The most hated company is even more so than Mengniu.
Brand new package. I have been using it for half a day. It is really good. The appearance and feel are no worse than Apple. The size is just right. It runs various programs smoothly. The sound from the dual speakers is very good.
"I bought it for my mother, thinking it would be enough for making phone calls and taking photos, but I was surprised by the blurry effect of the photos after I took a photo with my mother when I got home. The 5s does not have 1300 pixels."
The one I bought at 618 was much cheaper than usual. I didn’t have any lag at all when playing games. It was delivered by courier the next day. It was really hard work.
The mobile phone is in good condition. The mobile phone is really big and is a bit inconvenient to carry around.
"Why does the one with 16g of memory only have 10g more? It's not easy to use, the memory card can't be read, the reviews are bad, I'm too lazy to exchange or return the product! The sound quality of the speakers is really not complimentable"
"I asked for an invoice, but I didn't give it to you. After all, I am also a regular customer. Not satisfied with the service."
"If possible, Huawei's tablet will definitely surpass Apple's! What do you think?"
"There are fewer and fewer tablets to choose from. Nexus9 is old and needs to be replaced except for style and design. . . . Is it really just an enlarged version of a mobile phone? Other than that, I’m satisfied for the time being."
"Only then did I realize, where is the leather case that was given to me? Fly. Words don't count"
Never buy Mengniu again!
"Good, good, really good, good"
"Weiwei, you are great. Is your puppy still there? Mr. Pao went to pick strawberries to give to Wei’s mother, Mengniu or Yili!"
"The delivery was very fast. When I opened the box, I felt that the 8.4 screen was so big. I thought it was not much bigger than the 6.0 phone screen. After I got it, I realized how big it was."
"You don’t need anything if you choose it. The gifts don’t matter. It’s fine if you use it. It doesn’t matter because you don’t have to worry about it. There are no gifts, no tempered film, nothing, not even headphones."
Your mother forces you to advertise every day. You don’t drink Mengniu anymore. You stinky idiot.
Why is it so popular? Mengniu has released banana milk...
"COFCO Wugu Dojo and Mengniu are the two worst cards, Mr. Ning."
"It's so bad, the sound has become quieter after playing for a month"
The mobile phone charging interface is extremely loose
"I participated in the Mengniu #??? reunite, a little bit of happiness # event, come and show your little bits of happiness, hundreds of tablets are waiting for you! #test process # http:t.cn/zlWCrUT"
"Vanilla ice cream, from Mengniu, I like it."
"It's really big and convenient for mobile office use. Been using it for a while, very good."
"The stuff is okay, but even if it costs 999 after you buy it, there is no price guarantee."
"I've been using it for a while, and it's okay! I bought it just for kids to watch TV."
Huawei Honor Tablet is pretty good. Last year I bought a 7-inch one for playing with pesticides. This time I bought an 8-inch one for watching movies. It supports domestic production.
"It's so disgusting, Mengniu is disgusting, bugs are even more disgusting, and masturbating to bugs is the most disgusting thing! I wipe. . I've been drinking this for the past two days. . . . Never buy again! ! !"
"It feels like a refurbished product, nothing comes as a gift, and I feel very uncomfortable having it bare."
"I always buy from JD.com, it’s very good, door-to-door delivery, fast delivery, good service, I like it."
I bought it on the 24th. I accidentally slipped it in my hand and the screen broke. I have to be ready to replace the screen every moment.
"First of all, I immediately upgraded to the latest version after I got it. The optimization is good. I bought it just to watch videos and surf the Internet, so I don't feel stuck. However, the machine is quite heavy and my hands get tired after holding it for a long time. Overall good reviews"
"Very good, better than expected!"
I can’t say the quality is bad. The pixels are really bad and blurry. Especially the attitude of the customer service is very bad. They ignored me for a long time. I wouldn’t have come to your home if I didn’t fancy the bargain!
"When I first got it and opened it, I saw that there was a scratch on the body. When watching a movie, I couldn't click on the fast-forward bar. When it was full screen, it was black and white and I had to rotate it to remove the bar."
"This is the third time I have purchased it. It is as good as ever. It is absolutely authentic. The delivery is fast. The style is great and the quality is great. In short, it is great value for money and it is worth recommending."
"Very good. It’s the third day and no problems have been found. It’s great to have such a product at this price. The appearance, sound quality, and pixels are all very good. I support JD.com and will accompany me all the way. ???????"
"I have been using it for a while before reviewing it. I bought it for my wife. She likes it very much. I don’t play games. The basic functions are good, and the picture and sound quality are good."
"JD.com’s logistics is really good, but this Huawei phone is really not that good. It started to get hot on the second day of use! ! !"
"It's very easy to use, feels good, and the speed is pretty good. I've had enough watching the video."
"As expected, the resolution is okay, and overall it's okay."
Fast logistics and good quality
Huawei is awesome and supports domestic production. I am very satisfied.
"Very useful. Just not that fast. After all, the price is here. The sound quality is very good, beat the king. The team battle is slightly stuck"
"Huawei, Huawei, China is promising. The Apple pad at home is broken. This time I chose to support the domestic tablet. It is great. It is very balanced in all aspects. The only drawback is that the sound is not as good as expected. No matter what, I like it very much and recommend it to buy."
"Mengniu's ""Just a Little Happiness"" advertisement is very good. It's just an advertisement, which is really unflattering to its products and the way it responds to times of crisis."
"The camera video chat is blurry, and the price of the phone was reduced before it arrived. It’s so deceptive. Difference, difference, difference~"
Bad bad reviews. It’s cheap when you buy it. It’s really bad to use.
It's quite thin and light. I bought a 32G one. I can play Honor of Kings smoothly without any lag.
"It's not that good. It's not as cool as the Rubik's Cube I had before, and it's not as fast as it is."
"It had been 15 days when I discovered this problem, and I couldn't replace it, I could only repair it! The customer service recommended me to go to a nearby physical store for repair, and they replaced the screen with a new one after just a few uses!"
It feels pretty good. The effect of watching the drama is very good. It is also convenient to take it out to read the information.
The price dropped as soon as I bought it. There is no protective case. I will definitely give it a bad review.
I bought it on JD.com. It was a second-hand product and I have returned it. I am wondering whether to buy it on JD.com again.
"Bought this for a friend and said he likes it very much and the system is very smooth. Good reviews, domestic products are on the rise!"
Not easy to use! Super difficult to use
"It’s really fun to watch videos and comics, and it’s not tiring to hold it. It’s really useful for people like me who are short-sighted and don’t like to wear glasses."
"Oh no, no, no, the touch screen of the one that arrived on August 2nd broke after a month of use. I asked customer service and no one answered."
"The above is a breakfast combination before the age of 18. Asked me why there was no milk in the morning, I drank the milk as water, and after class I was slurping two pounds of Mengniu."
"No, the price was reduced the day after I bought it."
I was unlucky. They gave me a tablet with other people’s photos on it.
"After-sales service... said that a dedicated person will be used to track the repair progress, which is ridiculous."
This is the only one I can find. . Heavenly friends. There is no Mengniu light
"It doesn't get hot even after playing games for a long time. It has enough power, but it's a bit heavy. But the portion is enough and it's acceptable for both weight and quality. The sound effects are great."
Fast logistics! Baby it’s very useful! Rating 5 stars
"Not bad, there is no problem in using it. The word count has been fixed."
"It should be very good, but I haven’t used it yet. JD.com is very good, with good quality and low price, and fast logistics."
Dongdong is really not that good
I bought one for 1199 before. I want to buy another one now for only 779. It doesn’t maintain its value at all.
"It's okay and easy to use. I bought an m4. It must be quite expensive, so I just bought it. Just buy this one."
It’s a great tablet that can also be used as a phone. It’s very comprehensive!
"When Huawei P9 is charging, the metal back leaks electricity and there is a tingling feeling. I want to apply for a return. Jingdong is not doing well right now. The customer service is silent and no one answers the phone. I am not satisfied."
I am very satisfied. This is a birthday gift my mother bought me. I am so happy.
"Due to mobile payment restrictions, I bought three units in two installments. As a result, the one given to the elderly was actually a repair machine! ! What’s the point of someone else’s mugshot appearing on the new phone? ? Jingdong/Huawei, why don't you give me an explanation? ? ?"
"I have always been very satisfied with JD.com’s after-sales service. Both online and telephone customer service are patient and thoughtful, so I highly recommend it."
"Very good tablet, I have been using Huawei products!"
I bought the Fortune Edition and returned the China Unicom Edition I bought a few days ago. The Fortune Edition even came with a golden jacket! ! !
Give the naming rights to Mengniu.
The stuff is good.
"Needless to say, bad review! The battery is not fully charged after the second charge. It has been charged for a day and a night. It cannot support domestic products."
Reply Respect Mengniu’s attitude. I hope Mengniu can truly make good products and be worthy of the trust of the people.
This is recommended for my family to buy and it is my second time to buy it to meet your needs for tablets and your needs for games. . . M3 is worth buying...
"Mengniu! ! ! You are awesome! ! ! To deal with foreign affairs, we must first settle our domestic affairs, so let’s put aside the Diaoyu Islands issue for now, and then get rid of MB’s Mengniu. One issue after another, it’s too arrogant, and it doesn’t treat consumers as human beings!"
I bought it in March and it broke in May. What can I say? I believe it is a domestic product. Hahaha.
"It feels okay, but I don’t even have an ordinary film, so it’s useless."
"The delivery speed is extremely slow, so I must leave a negative review."
I’m so depressed. Is this a problem with the phone or the game?
The goods arrived within ten hours of placing the order. Give JD.com a thumbs up!
I love Deluxe. I like Mengniu. Not all milk is called Deluxe.
It's very good. I will come again if necessary. Thank you for the good review!
You can buy anything from Huawei. The domestic products are very cost-effective. My kids can watch Kazakhstan cartoons and my mom can watch Kazakhstan TV series. It’s pretty good.
"I don’t dare to drink Mengniu milk anymore, the news on the Internet is too scary!"
"I wanted to buy an Apple iPad before, but I didn’t expect Huawei’s tablet to be affordable and practical. It has an ultra-clear 2k screen, is ultra-thin and light, and is a joy to play."
Arrived very quickly. I have been using it for 2 days. The design and performance are very good. I like it very much.
My phone freezes and heats up. JD.com always switches customer service to shirk responsibility. JD.com is rubbish and I am disappointed.
"Seven days after I bought the phone, the sound broke out, leaving me speechless. The quality of JD.com’s self-operated products is no longer guaranteed. It is recommended not to buy it."
"They say the pixels are low, but it’s actually not bad. The video clarity is not inferior to that of high-end tablets."
I received the item and played with it for a few days before posting the order. My wife and daughter both like it. The only regret is that I didn’t buy an anti-fall cover.
"The Sunglow gold one is very nice and elegant, the tablet is easy to use, charges quickly and has a good battery life. Like it very much! Support Huawei! Jingdong express is also good, very fast, like it!"
"It's still fast, I bought it as a gift."
Mengniu breakfast milk tastes bad
"Bought this for my mother. She likes it very much. She said the response is very fast. Anyway, she only watches Dou Di Zhu TV series, so it should be enough."
"Rubbish, sometimes the screen won’t click, one star is all for the courier guy"
"The mobile phone is okay~ But the headphones that come with the phone are parallel imports~~ The wires are extremely thin, let’s not talk about it~ There is no sound when listening to music! ! ! ! Bad review! ! ! ! ! !"
"A very good tablet. The configuration is very good for the price. It is enough for playing games, watching videos and eating. I am satisfied. JD.com is trustworthy."
"It's quite smooth. There are too many pre-installed software. I have to delete it slowly. For a tablet that uses WiFi, Huawei membership software is of little use."
The baby is good. I have been looking at it for a long time and finally bought it. I like it.
"I didn't buy the high-end one. The old man liked the machine, but I personally thought it was a bit big."
"When I came out of the library at night, I saw a very bright star in the sky. I rubbed my eyes and found a few others... Thanks to Ah Lie for inviting me to drink Mengniu Sour Yogurt...@later--my name is Ah Lie"
"When I opened the box, I found a broken screen. There was an obvious bright spot in the lower left corner of the screen. I had no reason to return it within seven days. It was very troublesome to exchange the product. It was a very bad shopping experience."
"The box is not plastic sealed and is still dirty, and the screen has severe yellow spots when it is turned on. Most of them are shipped from a random repair machine in the warehouse."
"This phone tablet is good to use, I like it"
"The logistics is a bit slow, it took four days to arrive. . . ."
"I don't know if it's a Huawei problem or a JD problem. There are minor scratches on the back cover of the computer and traces of use on the power plug. After all, this was not purchased from Huawei’s official website."
"After reading the review and placing the order, it was indeed very good when I got it, comparable to a certain fruit. Be proud of Huawei? Be a national brand! Mr. Ren is a role model for Chinese entrepreneurs!"
"Very very good and fast. The picture is very clear, recommended to buy"
"The delivery is fast, the quality is good and the price is low. I am used to shopping on JD.com. It is very good and more convenient than supermarkets."
"Bad, bad, bad, really bad, not as good as *,"
"Good reviews, will add more after installation and trial"
"The tempered film is affixed, it’s terrible! I replaced the soft film again, but it's still terrible! Speechless..."
"It's rubbish. The screen often freezes and doesn't light up. What the hell, I advise everyone not to buy it. Be careful of being deceived."
"Not easy to use, don’t recommend buying it"
"The items are okay, but the delivery and logistics experience is not good. The estimated arrival time when placing the order is the same day, it will be delayed by one day after the photo is taken, and another day by the time of delivery."
"Bought this for my nephew, he loves it! It’s not fun to play on your mobile phone! I hope the quality can match it!"
"This phone is so rubbish. They all suspect that what you sold me is fake. This is the first time I have seen this happen to Huawei in many years. I am disappointed! ! It's a pity that I found it too late, otherwise I would definitely return it."
"Not bad, runs smoothly, but many applications require a Huawei account. The appearance is okay, but the black edges are a bit big."
"Overall, I'm quite satisfied..."
Of course I won’t drink the low-grade Mengniu! I haven’t drank Mengniu for many years!
"Leave a negative review silently. It doesn't work sincerely. Not even a pair of headphones. Bare metal. The fever is also quite severe. First time using Huawei, not a good impression"
It broke after more than two months of use. The touch screen broke.
"The logistics is very good, the goods were installed within an hour after receiving the phone call, I am very satisfied!"
"In general, the signal is not very stable. It shows that the wifi is full, but the Internet connection is stuck. The screen suddenly dims for some unknown reason and then automatically recovers after a while. In short, there are many inexplicable small problems."
"Not opened yet, not opened yet. Let’s give it a five-star rating for now. . . . . ."
"I don’t want to give it even one star. Within a month after I bought it, something went wrong and it couldn’t be turned on. I went to the after-sales service for less than a week and it couldn’t be turned on again. It also made strange noises. I don’t like it anymore."
"The reason I like Jingdong is that it is fast, fast delivery, fast delivery, and the baby has been received! It's being installed and will be used for my children's homework. I hope it won't disappoint me!"
Smearing is a problem with the quality of the tablet itself. Smearing is very serious and seriously affects the use. Don’t talk about professional terms. The user experience is screen smearing.
Garbage. The courier refuses to allow inspection. Jingdong Garbage
"It feels very good to use, especially the sound effect, which is much better than ordinary tablets."
"The pixels are too bad, the sliding unlock doesn't work, and the touch control doesn't work well. Fortunately, it's not expensive and the logistics is okay!"
It's very big. I bought it for my parents. They wanted something big. Very good to use.
"It supports domestic products, but it hasn’t worked yet. I’ll wait until I give it a good review. If there are any problems, I’ll solve them later."
"Regardless of whether it is true or not, I have stopped buying any Mengniu products for a long time."
"So big, so beautiful, sometimes a little stuck"
The sound quality is pretty good and the speed is pretty fast. I’m very satisfied.
"I don’t understand clearly, but it’s better to quit. I quit Mengniu Yili earlier, but now I have to quit Laomai, Kende Chicken, and Pizza Hut. Instead, eat Gaoming roasted chicken and Wudalang sesame pancakes. We also need healthy and sustainable development"
"No, it didn’t take long to get stuck."
It took me a long time to think of the review. I bought it for my dad. The running speed is not as fast as some other brand-name mobile phones. It’s a very disappointing purchase.
"There is no problem in using the machine, but there are few accessories (film), and the customer service is extremely irresponsible... I don’t want to say more because I am celebrating the Chinese New Year, so bad reviews are inevitable."
I have been using it for more than a month and it is pretty good. I just don’t know what the difference is between a larger tablet and a mobile phone??
"The thing is okay, the resolution is low and the camera is low, but it is still ok for elementary school, junior high school children or the elderly to play with. The customer service is amazing. I will never buy Huawei products from JD.com in the future."
"Not bad, I'm getting used to it. . ."
"The screen is big, big, big. Say important things three times! The machine works well. Shipping speed is also quite fast."
"Bought five at once, quick response, high-end"
"It took less than a month for the charger to charge and it couldn’t be charged. It’s really rubbish. When I called customer service, no one answered me. I was so speechless!"
"The system is smooth, the Internet speed is fast, the sound quality is good, the movies are good, the software is good, the tablet screen is clear, the touch screen is very sensitive and beautiful."
"Not good, second hand, too lazy to return it, probably I will never come to JD.com again."
"I can only laugh at Huawei stuff, the workmanship is too rough."
Logistics is fast and kids like it too.
My mobile phone is rubbish. I can’t even play Fantasy Westward Journey. It’s really rubbish.
"The logistics is very good, the tablet has been received, it is good, I like it"
"It's very good, very smooth, and worth buying, but there are no gifts!"
"The appearance is beautiful, the screen is outstanding, the slim design can be held with one hand, and the main Manhattan sound effect is not outstanding. If you like listening to music, don’t have high expectations for it."
Ask the master to install it. I used it that night and the effect was very good. good!
"Very good, Huawei is getting more and more powerful, and 128g can also expand the memory, which is fine. The service at Green Grass is very good and very welcoming."
"No, response is too slow"
"The call quality is not good, and the network signal is even worse. Very disappointing."
"It looks good, let’s try it out first. ."
Boycotting Japanese goods is not as good as boycotting Mengniu and Yili
The thing is not consistent with the real thing. I want to ask if it is a lie?
"Seriously, you get what you pay for! Not really good"
Definitely not buying Mengniu!
"Mengniu WeChat Customer Service: Hello, Mengniu is becoming safer and better. COFCO and Europe's largest dairy company Alshey have acquired Mengniu. Milk source and quality control will be further strengthened. I hope to restore your confidence in Mengniu."
"Huawei responds quickly, no worse than mini, it’s worth it! ! !"
"The logistics service attitude is very good, but it is delivered to towns and villages, but the address information cannot be delivered."
"Got it during the 618 big sale, very cost-effective, supports domestic products"
I finally bought it. It’s cost-effective and supports domestic products. I feel great after using it for a few days. Come on!
"This phone MD bought is really addictive. After using it for only a month, it frequently freezes. It’s not as good as hundreds of phones. It’s really a parallel import."
The so-called new one has such big scratches. I was also speechless.
"Mengniu headquarters, everywhere you can see is clean"
"Hello, Mengniu is becoming safer and better. COFCO and Europe's largest dairy company Arella have acquired Mengniu. Milk source and quality control will be further strengthened. I hope to restore your confidence in domestic milk and Mengniu."
"It’s so stuck. I don’t usually have anything late, I just watch a movie occasionally."
"Awesome, thank you Jingdong 518 for the event"
Repost to express that you will never forget Mengniu’s evil deeds and resolutely boycott Mengniu!
"The pixel count is too low, like a replica machine. It’s really not as good as a machine that costs 5-600 yuan! Product satisfaction 0 points! ! ! !"
"A very unsatisfactory purchase. No product manual, no warranty card. There are no problems with the tablet yet. Prompt delivery, simple packaging"
"It's obviously a defective product but it's shipped anyway, giving the store a bad review!"
"I watched the movie for my mother, okay? It’s useless to me. You get what you pay for."
Leave a negative review!
These judges Mengniu must have drunk too much. . No way. . .
"It looks very beautiful. When the goods arrived, my cousin couldn’t wait to open it."
"After drinking Mengniu milk for 5 years, you are considered a loyal fan. Maybe you can participate in this event. At the same time, please understand my personal belief and confidence in Mengniu~~~@??lonewolf20120609"
It’s just that the resolution is too bad and it’s very blurry.
"Expensive, the film provided does not match, return"
"Easy to use, Huawei is trustworthy, but a bit more expensive, the phone version"
"I don’t believe in China’s student milk, let alone Mengniu. If students order Mengniu milk, I won’t let my children order it even to death."
"I just got off work and went shopping in Hongyun. I stopped at the children's drink at Wahaha Baby for a long time, but I still didn't have the courage to buy it. I was afraid that my mother would tell me when I got home, so it was better to choose Mengniu's drink. Alas! I've really grown up and I can't go back to my childhood."
"There is a big white mark on the white screen! It’s very conspicuous, and it’s so lazy to exchange hundreds of dollars for something!"
The battery life is too bad. It only reaches 25% after watching videos for an hour.
"Very good, arrived in 3 days. It is very simple for family members to install it by themselves and is easy to operate. Just wait for the reflection to appear, and everything else will be fine. Midea is a great brand"
"Very impressive, Huawei is getting better and better. Like it very much,"
Jingdong is very bad
I bought it as a backup for my husband on a business trip. I have barely used it. The sound from the earpiece is too noisy and I can’t even hear what I’m saying.
"The delivery was very fast, but the phone is very rubbish. The Huawei buttons are inside and they won’t pop out at every turn. What else can you do besides restarting? Also, it's stuck"
"I bought one to watch the surveillance. It’s very good, full marks."
The quality feels pretty good and the operation is relatively smooth.
Mengniu’s advertisement is so disgusting and a blatant lie!
"False resolution and slow operation? . . . It doesn't feel good, it's all empty."
"It feels pretty good, but I’m not used to the return button."
"Needless to say, this price is too good. ."
"After using it for less than a month, the volume button failed and I got drunk. Now I wonder if this is a refurbished machine?"
"The machine is of good quality, the system runs fast, the Internet speed is fast, and you can also make phone calls. Like it."
What a terrible phone
Very slow and easy to get hot. The sound on the phone is also very low.
It feels good to give it as a gift
The price is quite cheap. It’s good for the elderly at home to watch TV.
The tablet was received. The express delivery was very fast. I placed the order in the morning and it was delivered in the afternoon. The machine is also good and there are no problems.
The name of this Mengniu milk is awesome.
"When I bought it, I said there was a gift but I didn’t get anything. *It’s a lie if you don’t get anything~"
"JD.com doesn’t give you returns, the service is terrible, the customer service doesn’t contact you, it’s just perfunctory, it’s really OK, JD.com"
"The price is right, but there is still a gap compared with Apple. The sound effect is not as good as expected and the resolution is average. Satisfies general entertainment, but I am a fan of Huawei. I have been comparing with Xiaomi, but I still chose this one."
I personally like Mengniu’s new clothes and support them.
Mengniu makes you stupid ~ make ???.. Do you want to make egg tarts? ..???=Foodies continue to receive benefits!
It feels good in the hand. I just got it and haven’t used it yet. It looks great.
Mengniu pure milk plus Maxwell coffee. . . It tastes good.
Huawei and JD.com are invincible
"Very good, please type 10 words for a good year."
"Less than a month after I bought the tablet, the screen started to automatically black out. It would go black at every turn, at any time and place. The customer service asked me to take off the leather case and restore it to factory settings. I tried everything, but the screen still blacked out automatically."
I was selling dog meat at the expense of others. I introduced the display chip Mali-T628 MP4 when I bought it. I got the display chip ARM MALI-T624. Below is the test picture of Master Lu.
"The item was okay, but the price was reduced on the day it arrived. I applied for price protection, but was rejected."
"The price changes every day, and the fluctuation is the biggest problem. As for using this kind of marketing method for a tablet with this configuration, it’s just a matter of killing one by one."
It's so stuck that it freezes when I open UC or Thunder.
"Very cost-effective, thumbs up, supports domestic products."
"Bad review, the gifts are not included at all, it’s a lie."
"What do you think of the milk here? Mengniu’s domineering attitude is revealed, Terensu"
"It’s not easy to use...I haven’t even received the tablet yet, but they started giving me a protective film."
"It can be used, it is almost universal in the system, and it is easy to install. It would be nice if you get a protective cover."
"The pixels are so fucking bad. There is talk time in the parameter, so why can’t I insert a mobile phone card?"
Just got it back! Good looks! Review after use!
"It’s not good, and the price was reduced not long after I bought it. The touch screen is not accurate and there is nothing. There is no case or film."
Jingdong’s self-operated logistics is fast and the goods are genuine at a reasonable price! praise!
"I just bought it the day before, and it was reduced by 80 yuan the next day. The price was not guaranteed, and it was useless to contact customer service."
"Easy to use without talking, ten words have been entered"
"Not bad, the screen is big, good for reading novels!"
"The first headphone jack is broken and cannot be used to plug in headphones, and the second back case has scratches. . . Unable to complain. Er Shaodong"
"The grainy feeling is really strong. If you are used to high-resolution mobile phones and tablets, you will definitely feel uncomfortable. In addition, it is easy to heat up. It was quite hot after using it for less than ten minutes."
"Regardless of the quality, the website clearly shows that the product is in stock, so why do we have to wait 6 days for delivery..."
"Sure enough, the Huawei brand is better, and the resolution is pretty good. This is the one I’m using for the review now. It’s great!"
"I have been paying attention to it for a long time. I bought it for my husband to play games. I have never used the Android system. I am still exploring it. Other than that, it is pretty good."
Movies turn yellow when watching movies. It’s not easy to use sometimes when running comics.
Add some raisins and walnut kernels to the Mengniu fruit...it tastes good...
"It’s been a month since the invoice was sent, and it hasn’t been mailed yet. No contact has been made. Bad review."
Mengniu has created a miracle!
"Trust Huawei, a big domestic brand, easy to use, perfect as a gift for family and friends"
"Really bad. Don't buy it, everyone. . . . . . . . ."
"It's very good. I don't think there is any problem with the screen. The speed of 950 is fine and I can play King of Kings without any lag. However, the WiFi is really inferior to that of mobile phones. The tablet has a lot of lag under the same WiFi."
"The quality is not good, the screen turned white after three days, so I have to repair it. I am worried that it will become worse with more repairs."
"Yes, Huawei is a trusted domestic brand and supports domestic production. It's good to use, no lag or heat, the resolution is quite high, a national brand??"
"Brothers and sisters who have been interning at Mengniu over the years, are you all okay? I remember that we encouraged each other to persevere. Now I am still here, where have you been?"
"It feels like a refurbished machine, please be careful when buying it"
"After using it for a day, I feel it's okay. I originally bought it to play games, but I found that there are quite a lot of incompatible software. After the system update, the dragging seems to be better. (Personal feeling) ps: I held an event the day after I bought it. It's really frustrating..."
"Everything is fine with my M2, but it has a conflict with JD.com. I always get stuck when browsing JD.com?"
The touch screen of the phone is not good. I have to swipe several times to open the phone. I am disappointed.
"I always drink Mengniu's, it tastes very good"
"Rubbish, rubbish, it started to stop working after a month of use"
"Does this tablet come with a matching tempered film, leather case, and headphones? If you have a link, please send me a link, thank you! Delivery is fast! This is the characteristic of Jingdong!"
"Good, very clear"
"It’s okay, let’s take a look again after a while."
"Dad said it was not bad, it was a pleasant shopping, thank you boss!"
"Can make phone calls, can cover half of the face, and the sound quality is beyond imagination"
"Don’t drink Mengniu, don’t drink Coca-Cola"
"I really feel bad about it, and no one even answered the questions I asked the customer after receiving the goods."
I feel like I bought a small memory and it’s not enough.
It is recommended not to buy it. There is a current sound when plugging in headphones.
"I haven’t used it yet and don’t know how to use it, but it’s okay at this price."
It’s so stuck that I can’t find a solution through customer service.
"Not bad, my wife likes it very much"
"Not bad, very beautiful and easy to use."
"Mengniu, you are well done! Not only is it open year-round,"
The most dissatisfied thing is that there is no electronic invoice
The size is suitable and the speed is quite fast. I tried it out and it feels pretty good so far.
"The signal is very good, not bad, the reception is very fast, the appearance is also good, like it?"
"Always stuck, crashed, slow to respond"
The resolution is really too low. It hurts my eyes when I look at it. I hope Huawei can improve it.
"It's very fast, the stuff is pretty good."
"Received the item, very good. satisfy."
The last one is compared with the iPad mini. It is a little slender and feels good when holding it.
I placed the order at 8 o'clock last night and received it at 8 o'clock this morning. There was no lag at all. I just got a little hot while playing games.
All the gifts that I had when I put them in the shopping cart are gone.
This phone works great! The internet speed is very fast! It’s just that the running memory is a little too small!
"It's a very good phablet phone. The screen is big enough, and watching movies online is very smooth. I'm very satisfied with this phone. It would be even better if the running memory reaches 4G and the phone has 32G of memory! ! !"
How does the machine perform? Is the heat dissipation good? How is the quality of the accessories? Tell everyone about your experience of using it!
"The tablet is so-so, much lower than expected. The sound is too small, the pixels are too low, and the response is slow. It is not suitable for the elderly, and it is impossible for young people to buy it. It's useless, I regret buying it. Charging takes longer than draining. Logistics is very fast"
"32g is actually only 24g, which is super cheating! ! !"
"The stuff should be good, I bought it for a friend! !"
"Very good, very good, very good, very good"
The best post so far! Use Mengniu! @stocktonyoko
"What are you pretending to be? Don’t drink domestic milk powder. Do you want to drink Mengniu Yili? Do you want to eat domestically produced fruits and vegetables? Do you breathe the mainland air? If domestic products are not good, just leave. It also saves resources."
"Let’s not talk about the product for now. First, give the courier guy a like. I called the courier guy in advance because I had to catch the train, and he delivered it in time, with 32 likes."
"Stuck, garbage"
"Haven’t installed it yet, will review after using it."
"After using it for a few days, the screen broke. I asked how much it would cost to replace the screen. Customer service** went to a nearby repair shop** to get it replaced. What a liar."
"Negative review, I bought it at *yuan on November 6th and bought it at a price cut of *yuan on November 10th. Both were Double Eleven events. JD.com’s price dropped too fast. I asked for a refund of the difference."
It’s okay to start using it~~~~Good choice
I recently fell in love with Youyi C and Guanyi Milk! @ Mengniu
"One charges very slowly and the signal is not good! Retired! I bought another one and it turned out to be a defective product. . Accepted. . It was a huge blow to me, who has been using Huawei products, as I had problems with 2 units in a row. . All right! Make me look bad! Don’t buy Huawei anymore!"
"There are a lot of software in the new phone you buy. Unlike buying a mobile phone, it doesn’t come with anything. You need to download and run the system yourself. It always feels like a second-hand phone, and there are no gifts, not even the simplest film."
"Poor, poor. After I came back, there was a lot of noise inside. When I tried to communicate with customer service, they were blocked. I couldn’t send messages. I really recommend my friends not to buy it."
"Good performance, fast delivery, and reliable quality. Really good."
"The touch screen is not sensitive, the system is not smooth, it is simply garbage among garbage."
Mengniu Guanyi Milk is delicious and easy to use~
"Jingdong is so rubbish, it dropped by 400 in 3 days, I’m really convinced!"
I bought it for my mother. It’s been used well so far?
"The sound quality is good, the touch screen is very sensitive, the system is smooth, and it supports domestic products and Huawei."
"Hey, I promised to send a protective case, but it didn’t come out. I was drunk and deceiving consumers. Hey, I was drunk. This is my first negative review. The box is quite big and it’s all empty. I’m convinced..."
"I really like Mengniu’s advertisements. Happiness is never abstract. In fact, love is the same. Abstraction is a kind of prevarication for oneself and life..."
It’s so easy to use. I liked it right away. It looks better than Apple. I like it very much!
The network is too slow
Mengniu is awesome
The sound is still good
Dahuang screen customer service also said what the most reasonable screen display is. It’s my first time to buy Huawei. It’s really enough.
"It feels like it's a second-hand phone, at least the ones that were returned within seven days. The film is no longer original, and I regret it. The shell behind the speaker protrudes again, and it flattens when I press it. The battery is not durable"
"Very cost-effective, the screen is big enough, and the movie viewing is superb!"
"Rubbish merchants, deceiving buyers."
Buy an M2 from the m3 link. Keep your eyes open and don’t be fooled.
"Bought for my children, very cost-effective, supports domestic products"
"I bought it just to watch the drama. It's okay, right?"
"Full-featured, easy to use, fast"
Logistics is super rubbish!
Poor thermal insulation effect
"The long worms illustrate from one aspect that they are all natural, pesticide-free and residue-free. I have stopped drinking Mengniu Yili for several years. Those who don’t want to eat worms should resist it! ! !"
"Bought this for my mom to watch the video. It's pretty good and smooth, but the black edges are touching."
The tempered film and leather case are garbage. . . It's all lies
"very good. . . Awesome, cheaper than physical stores, and the stuff is genuine! ! ! !"
"All the electronic products at home are bought from JD.com, which is self-operated, so the quality cannot be said."
"If you like shopping on JD.com and use it in your company, you can issue special VAT invoices."
Huawei can be trusted
"There is no protective cover or film, which is a pity"
Wukong Loves Bone Demon: I have long started to ask my friends and relatives around me not to buy Mengniu Yili. Everyone votes with their feet. This kind of unscrupulous enterprise cannot survive. Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu!
I just received the goods and it’s useless? But it's pretty big.
Fast logistics and good service. I am using it and feel good.
"The 128g memory is completely sufficient, the sound quality and screen are indeed good, but the battery life is so-so."
"It’s really frustrating and uncomfortable to watch Ding Junhui play now, and the Mengniu logo he is wearing is especially uncomfortable to watch!"
"The delivery is really fast, the water heater has been installed, the after-sales service attitude is very good, and the products are good, the quality is very good, and it is very comfortable to use. Thank you seller!"
"The quality of the things is good. I always trust JD.com, great! !"
"Very good, good"
"Jingdong's price guarantee agreement is a piece of paper. The price will be reduced the next day after purchase. After communicating with customer service, they only said that Jingdong would return the coupon, but not the cash."
"In the past, you could pay with two cards on JD.com, but now you can’t. I don’t know if the delivery person is unwilling because of the trouble or if JD.com’s system is getting worse."
"Junk product, the resolution and camera are very poor and the pictures are not as good as those of copycat phones."
Not bad. It’s good to watch TV.
"It's a very poor thing. I'll give it 0 points for its appearance, 2 points for its running speed, and 2 points for its overall appearance. It's a bit laggy when playing Honor of Kings. I give 1 point for service. I regret buying a Huawei tablet."
"The price was reduced by 100 yuan in just a few days after being used normally, and no rights protection was given."
"It's really not that good, it's really bad, it's bad, it's bad"
Why are there no gifts? Why are there no gifts? Why are there no gifts? Say the important question three times! The explanation is that there is no such thing as love!
"Just received it, haven’t used it yet,"
It's a nice tablet that's fast and offers great value for money.
"It doesn't feel very good, and the heat dissipation is average. The screen effect is very average. The key is that the frame is wide, and you can see a circle of black lines on the screen inside. It feels very low-end and cheap."
"It feels good to use, the screen is clear, the box is equipped with the original soft film, and when booting, it prompts the system to update to emui5.0, which is relatively smooth. I hope 5.0 can exert its intelligent effect and maintain smoothness."
"The baby has been received, it is so beautiful. It lived up to my expectations. Especially the delivery man worked very hard to deliver the goods so quickly. Thanks……"
"It's much better than expected, the smoothness is good and the operation is more sensitive. Although there is still some gap compared to the iPad, considering that the price is only one-third of the fruit machine, it is very good."
Very good phone. Honor phone is good.
Thanks Mengniu
"Very good, fast, like it"
Boycott Mengniu!
"Stay away from Mengniu and Yili, stay away from 360. These are all certain things."
"The black borders of M3 are much smaller than that of M2, and it looks beautiful. The mobile phones I use are V8 and Honor 6, and there is also a 4C sent by China Telecom."
The speed is good and the sound effects are good too
A great tablet that can run various large-scale games smoothly and has a good feel.
"Mengniu's banana milk is super delicious, with a rich milk flavor, fragrant and smooth"
"Nothing sent, bad review"
"The authentic ones are much cheaper than those in physical stores. They are really good value for money. The seller is also very good, and the delivery is fast. After the goods arrived, I called Midea’s after-sales service number and they quickly sent an installer to install it. I used it in the evening."
"It is said that all Netcom mobile cards can be used, but China Unicom’s cards cannot be used, right?"
"This delivery pisses me off. ! What speed! The customer said it would arrive in 2 days, but it took 8 days to arrive."
The express delivery was super fast. It was shipped from the warehouse closest to me. I placed the order at noon yesterday and it arrived at around 3 o'clock today. I am very satisfied.
"The decibel rate is too bad, the downloaded and cached videos cannot be watched, and the after-sales service shirks its responsibilities... It's really bad to the extreme, so bad that it couldn't be any worse."
"Not bad, supports domestic products"
Huawei mobile phones don’t work
"Very satisfied, will visit again next time"
Too much! Repaired in less than a month
"good! Since the first incident, I have rejected Mengniu and Yili. No matter how sad the other party is to repent, I don't want to condone their mistakes."
"You get what you pay for, so stuck"
The water heater has been installed and has not been used yet. It feels good. I gave a lot of gifts. A good and honest seller. I will come again in the future.
Fall in love with the taste of Mengniu kefir...
"Just so-so, low pixels and low resolution, suitable for children to play with casually."
"Except for poor battery life, everything else is good"
I feel that the front camera does not have 13 million pixels and the photo quality is not good.
"It's been a great experience. JD.com's service is great, and the tablet is easy to use."
Logistics is super slow.
"Stuttering, very stuck, special stuck, stuck in playing games, watching movies, everything, just like the products a few years ago"
The most unhappy shopping experience was at the Huawei JD flagship store. What did you see when you went to the store? The grocery store didn't even give me an invoice for all the crap. They returned the goods and blackmailed me*. It was so annoying. What the hell.
"Anyway, it is a backup camera and is rarely used for taking pictures. Just give it a bad review and forget about it!"
"What do you mean? I can’t even read the phone card. Please exchange it! You told me earlier that you can't read the phone card. It's really annoying that people bought it and can't read the mobile phone card! Alas, really disappointed"
"It’s extremely bad. The page says there are gifts, but if you buy it, it says there are no gifts. It’s a typical liar."
"The water heater is great! The water was still hot after a few days. I reported the installation at 10pm, and the master came the next day. The service attitude was good. Although it cost 100 yuan for materials (two triangular valves and two stainless steel bellows), it felt good!"
Bad review and it crashed after 2 days of use.
This screen resolution is perfect for watching videos with mosaics. It’s made in China. I can’t believe it.
"The sound quality is good for watching TV series, the speed is fast, and it’s not expensive."
"My son played with it for one day, and the screen was cracked the next day, so he spent another 260 to replace it."
"I bought two for my kids to play with. Children like it very much, it should be good."
"The item is very good, just like what was introduced online. The express delivery is also very fast. It arrived the next day. I give it a thumbs up."
"It turns on normally, feels good, looks beautiful, is easy to carry and practical."
"When I applied the film today, I found small black spots on the screen. I don’t know if it has any effect. I won’t return it. I’ll talk about it if I have any questions in the future. I’m very dissatisfied with this purchase."
"Not bad, the screen is big, the response is good, supports Huawei Honor"
"The sound quality is excellent, and it can be used for watching movies and playing games. The camera has average pixels, but it is enough, and it is not used for taking pictures. The battery life needs to be improved. It will run out of power after watching movies for 3-4 hours."
"The boot speed is super fast, the picture is clear, it is a very good tablet"
"In an era when you didn't dare to drink milk for fear of being accidentally ""poisoned"" by Mengniu or Yili, the old yogurt from grandma on the roadside made you put down your stomach buds and it was rare to take a sip with confidence."
"Not very good, very bad"
"Reply That’s right. Imported milk powder is no fun either. Mengniu is happy to see it. In fact, as long as Mengniu is under foreign control, the public will remain silent if problems arise!"
"The quality is quite poor, very watery! After only using it for a month or two, it almost exploded while charging. The charger and the phone socket were burned out and blackened. I will never buy Huawei again!"
"The appearance is very poor, and the touch is not very good."
"Big bad review, the mobile phone signal is not good, the signal is only one bar, if I switch to another phone, it will be full. And the express delivery didn’t arrive the next day. The happy birthday I planned to deliver on the same day only arrived the next day. I was so disappointed!"
Very good and very powerful! ! Running speed soars
It's just arrived. The sound quality is also good.
"Bought for dad, not bad"
"The express delivery is super fast and the running speed is also very fast. Great, JD.com’s self-operated products are guaranteed."
"This shopping trip was quite depressing. I placed an order for the X2 dual 4G version on March 4th, but received the mobile version on March 5th."
Shop bully xx
"I've been using it for a few days, is it good? Very fast"
Delivery timely and good
"After using it, I commented that the sound quality is good for watching movies and the screen is OK, but it does get hot after playing a few games."
"Not bad, but the price is a bit expensive"
"I don’t have the headphones, I don’t even have the invoice, what’s the deal, I have to leave a negative review."
"It's okay, my mom likes it very much, but it's a bit slow to start up."
"I have been wanting to buy this tablet for a long time, and I finally bought it this time! I just received the tablet and have not used it yet. I will review it later! Special thanks to the customer service guy who has been eager to answer all my questions! So loving!"
"It’s really bad. When I watch TV by myself, the phone will turn off and on by itself."
Big brands guarantee a pleasant online shopping!
The speed is very fast and the picture is very clear.
This is my first time using Huawei and I am very satisfied.
bad bad
"It feels like it's okay to use, and the sound quality is really good, but the pixels are not that good and are lacking. A pair of headphones were given as a gift, and it would be great if a protective case could be given as a gift."
"I bought it and it dropped by * yuan within 8 hours, but I can’t guarantee the price. Worst time"
"Not bad, good, second one"
"The tablet runs fast, the workmanship is fine and beautiful, and there is no jamming."
Rubbish. Jingdong is becoming more and more rubbish. This phone is not connected to the Internet
"Average, not very good. The screen is not very clear. My eyes hurt after watching it for a long time."
"Not bad, it’s very fast to use, very good"
Mengniu’s banana milk tastes pretty good
"The store is very bullying, 618 is the worst shopping experience, I will not buy anything on JD.com"
"Authentic, good reviews."
"It took me a while to review this gift from my husband. It feels great, especially the sound effect is very good."
"Nothing came as a gift. I read in the reviews that it came with a tempered film and a protective case. When I got it, I didn’t get anything. It’s so unauthentic and stingy."
"Supports Huawei, good performance, suitable for children to study, clear enough, fast enough"
Mengniu can't afford to get hurt if he drinks too much
"It's pretty good. It's my first time using Huawei's products. The overall experience is good, the battery life is great, the appearance is elegant, and the performance is good."
"Watching videos doesn’t stutter at all, and playing games is great too. support. support."
Can not be used. Come on?
"Damn it, are you sure this thing works? ? ? ? This problem occurred when I first arrived? ? ? ? ? This is obviously used. It can't be turned off even if I turn it off, and it can't be turned on even when I turn it on."
I just bought it for my girlfriend and the charger broke after less than half a month of use. I just hehehe. Goodbye Jingdong!
"After using it for a month, the memory cannot be read. It is garbage."
"Mengniu and Wahaha are all distribution experts, but milk powder distribution is really different from general fast-moving consumer goods distribution, and the terminal operation is more complicated!"
I started giving away stuff the day after I bought it. Sad oh sad/sad
This is a very satisfying purchase for me. I like this item very much and am very satisfied with it.
"Very easy to use, big screen, system runs very smoothly, fingerprint unlocks in seconds"
The big screen is great for watching movies and listening to music. The sound and picture quality are great. It took me a few days to review it. It’s genuine!
"Do you like Mengniu Big Fruit? Anyway, I love it very much."
"Logistics is too slow, quality is average~"
The resolution is too low and too blurry! The system is too low and has not been upgraded!
I bought it for my dad to watch videos and listen to music. It’s good. Dad likes it very much.
"Beautiful appearance, fast and easy to operate. I bought it for my dad. It’s good."
"Mengniu, I have already gone from disappointment to despair... How does this industry comfort our wounded hearts?"
"It's good, I like it very much, but it's a bit heavy as a gift. I don't know if it comes with a film or not if I don't give it as a gift."
"I participated in Mengniu’s #??????,???happiness# event, come and show off your little bits of happiness, hundreds of tablets are waiting for you! http:t.cn/zlQzW9I"
"Mengniu was actually advertised on Sina Weibo, bah, bah, bah"
"No problem has been found so far, it feels fine"
It's very good. It was recommended by a friend. It's very good for a family of three. The seller's service is very good. Continue to pay attention to the seller.
Bought for my parents. The tablet at this price is already very powerful and my parents like it very much.
"I didn’t get anything given as a gift, not even a film or a protective case. I’m so disappointed."
"I haven’t drank Mengniu for a long time, but I think I’ll have to stick to it in the future."
"Not bad indeed, not bad. It feels comfortable in the hand, easy to operate and responsive."
It’s hard to imagine that Mengniu has so many problems and yet it’s still on the market and there are still people buying it.
Very good Very good
"On the one hand, it is constantly carrying out promotional activities, and on the other hand, quality problems are frequently exposed. Mengniu is very busy, and this is not how the brand image is established."
I have purchased Huawei tablets many times and they are very good! Stable and smooth!
There is no Mengniu. Mengniu should work hard and strive to be on the list in 2013...
", overall not bad"
"The screen pixels are not high, mainly because it is very slow to run. It is a plastic case. I always thought it was an integrated metal case. The battery power is consumed very quickly. The only advantage is that it is cheap. Money is hard money these days!"
Screen resolution is not high and very average
It’s not good at all. It doesn’t even come with a leather case or tempered film. It’s my first time buying something like this.
It's just so-so and the propaganda contains false information. I don't recommend buying it.
Customer service garbage
"Not installed, used."
"We always support domestically produced devices. Huawei is really easy to use. Our whole family uses them, including our children’s tablets. All are Huawei."
"Very bad, the size of the film sent is not suitable. The machine is also very slow and the display is very unclear. Obvious color spots can be seen"
"Hey...Mengniu, why bother?"
Another Mengniu complaint
"The express delivery is very good, but it is better to buy electronic products in physical stores. The after-sales service is too slow when buying online! Why"
"The price reduction is too fast, the difference between yesterday and today is huge, I really feel cheated!"
"Jingdong was so incompetent this time, it took two days to arrive, it was running slowly, the ergonomics were unreasonable, and the sound quality was poor."
"ok, pretty good"
"Very good, I got it at a flash sale price of over 900, very cost-effective, high quality and low price"
"Fast delivery. 32g is enough. And there are activities, which is good"
"Not bad, the screen is big, it doesn’t strain your eyes when using it"
"According to industry insiders, he never drinks Mengniu milk or eats candied fruits. Yuanfang, what do you think?"
I like Mengniu’s new packaging! !
"You can also watch TV and play games, which is great"
"#? thirst# In addition to Crystal Milk Tea, my other favorite drink is the aloe flavor of Mengniu Real Fruit Granules. Although it is from Mengniu, it is really delicious. But they definitely can’t surpass Pepsi!"
"I used a tablet to evaluate it! Very good, very practical"
The phone is good and the battery lasts a long time.
"What the hell, you don’t even get a pair of earphones when you buy a mobile phone, and you won’t get a refund if you return it. You should see clearly what you get before you buy it. Don’t let others fool you! ! !"
"There are too many commercials for Good Voice, including Mengniu. Too many ads."
"Good, good, very good, good, good, good"
"Some of the contacts are not working properly, and the edges of the screen are damaged. I opened the package after the deliveryman left. As a result, the edges of the screen are damaged, and the response is a bit slow when typing. I want to exchange it, but I don’t know how to do it!"
"Fast delivery, high resolution, fine workmanship, delicate display, can be upgraded to system 7.0, excellent sound effects, fast fingerprint response, 4G storage, and expandable memory. Anyway it's good"
It’s a rubbish tablet. I just bought it and it’s so laggy when I play Honor of Kings.
"Today, on the third day of use, it doesn’t feel that good. After being fully charged, it ran out of power after watching videos for five hours! It’s quite stuck when I use it! Suffered a loss!"
"The appearance of the phone is okay, but there is a slight lag when playing games."
"On the other hand, there were no gifts during the Flat Festival. There were gifts of sheaths in the days before and after, which made me extremely unhappy. This so-called activity on JD.com is really pure fraud."
It's great. I have been using it for a long time without any problems. My family likes it very much!
"Well, the touch screen feel is still much worse than that of Apple~ Considering the price is so different, it’s still a good deal~"
The speed is still very fast. What is very frustrating is that some Apple games cannot be downloaded by Huawei.
Cheating Mengniu spokesperson
It’s also difficult to cut after changing the packaging. It’s Mengniu again! ! !
"Purchased many times, Huawei is a big domestic brand, Honor! ! ! !"
"Shipping is super slow, arrival is too late!"
"Yes, very cost-effective, I will buy it again next time, but my eyes are dry after watching it for a long time"
"Overall it looks okay, let’s use it first."
"Boycott Mengniu or boycott Japanese products, which one is more important? The Diaoyu Islands are related to national interests and dignity, and Mengniu Milk is related to national health and lives. Which one is more hateful? Japan is a foreign enemy and Mengniu is a national traitor. Which one should be beaten more?"
"The price/performance ratio is pretty good, but the smoothness is still not as good as Apple's"
Where did the promised one-year LeTV membership go? Negative review
Cell phones are okay. . Can't you give me a mobile phone case? So stingy!
"Damn, there are no molds. Damn, it’s really bare metal. Usually buyers have molds. It also has a bad touch and poor click."
"The configuration is high, the network speed is fast, and the screen is clear. I only reviewed it after using it for half a month. Very supportive."
"Bought for my mother, suitable for older eyes. It’s just not very convenient to carry"
You can insert a card to make a call. It feels slightly heavy. The quality of Huawei's products is not bad.
"Mengniu, a Chinese conscientious enterprise!"
"It's so bad that it disabled one of my cards, and the signal is super bad. First negative review! ! ! ! !"
"They didn't even give me a condom, which was a bit dissatisfying. It turned out to be a micro card, but I went to the mobile store to cut it into a mini card. The beauties of mobile should give it a thumbs up!"
poor clarity
"Overall, good"
Huawei (HUAWEI) M3 8.4-inch tablet (2560x1600 Kirin 950 Harman Kardon sound effect 4G/32G WiFi) Rihui Gold
The tablet is very good and the system is smooth. I keep repurchasing it.
The milk produced by Mengniu is just not good. I never drink it. I only buy Sanyuan and Yili milk.
It works great and the delivery is fast! support!
"The tablet is mainly for playing games and watching videos! But the experience of both is very poor. When playing Honor of Kings, the sound will be stuck, and the picture smoothness is not enough! When watching a high-definition movie, if the screen moves a little faster, it will obviously feel like the picture is too unsmooth!"
"The express delivery is great, the service attitude is good, and the products are consistent with the online description. I will continue to support JD.com"
"Refund, it’s funny, you’re funny, why didn’t you tell me when I placed the order this morning, don’t buy this order, you have to return it after you bought it."
"Rubbish, the price will be reduced when it arrives, the system is stuck and slow, and the signal is poor! Please consider!"
"It looks good, but will it slow down after being used for a long time?"
Not bad...not bad
"Very good, the screen is clear and bright, it is genuine"
"In any industry, so-called state-owned enterprises have appeared, and there is no such thing as healthy competition. Since becoming a state-owned enterprise... they have become more unscrupulous... I am very confused as to why Mengniu has not closed down yet."
I like it. It’s convenient. It saves on consumption. Mainly it’s also cheap. I especially like the things from Jingle. It’s convenient and affordable. Fast delivery. Good stuff. It saves time when going to the supermarket. Mainly the stuff is of good quality.
Arrived very quickly and installation was prompt. It’s just that the accessories are a bit expensive.
"The reaction is slow, the characters seem distorted when watching TV, and the power consumption is very fast, which is far from what I imagined!"
The cpu is too bad and it’s not smooth at all. It’s a loss.
I didn’t even give me a bad review on the invoice.
Not bad after use!
It has nothing to do with the merchant. I just want to give bad reviews when I buy something from JD.com.
"The service is very poor, the mobile phone is not easy to use, and it feels not genuine."
"Very good, good quality and cheap"
"If you buy it at a loss, it’s not as good as Lenovo’s yoga."
"The delivery speed is fast, and the small tablet is also good. Children like it."
Unscrupulous businessman! Boycott Mengniu @ yinglongtengsihai
The deviation from the marked memory is too large
The customized version of Zhu Xian is very valuable. The LeTV membership it gives is worth more than 100. The Zhu Xian gift package you get can be sold online even if you don’t play it. It is much more valuable than the regular version.
Mengniu has updated its packaging. Very nice
Touch screen is not sensitive
Mengniu finally realized that it was worse than cutting cakes. Cutting cakes cost Mengniu life.
Totally disappointed with Mengniu!
"When I opened the box...the membrane was torn...it affected my shopping mood. When I asked customer service, I said sorry and sorry, ugh...it really affected my mood."
"When I sent it, it felt like it was second-hand and very dirty, so I returned it."
The operation is not sensitive enough and the game freezes.
It should be okay. I gave it to my dad on his birthday. I haven’t heard of any problems.
"A bit stuck, average quality. ."
"Reply, no! Are there any discounts? Hello, thank you for your love for Mengniu products. I am Mengniu WeChat customer service. Welcome to follow me."
"The price is expensive, the price is expensive, the price is expensive, the price is expensive, the price is expensive,"
Mengniu is stupid
This thing is still okay for this price.
Bought for my wife’s birthday gift! satisfy!
"My favorite is Mengniu’s yogurt and melon seeds, the original ones."
I won’t drink Mongolian milk from now on! distrust. Mengniu? Chinese people don’t believe it!
Mengniu is good! The name sounds very powerful! ~
I haven’t had Mengniu for a long time. I changed the packaging and it looks better than before.
"I can no longer complain about Mengniu, my brain is 360 degrees full of blind spots?_?"
"Not bad, very good"
"I haven’t used it yet, so I don’t know how it works."
The 999 flash sale and the 25-yuan coupon are very cost-effective. I bought it as a gift for my parents. The size is just right and it is light. Go online and watch a drama at home. It’s comfortable and you don’t need it.
". I got it as a gift yesterday and tried it out. It feels pretty good, and playing games is smooth. Among domestic tablets, Huawei is the most trustworthy."
"Fast delivery, in use"
It fits just right in your hand and has a large battery capacity
"The stuff is very good, the key is the battery is good, great!"
Very good......................
"I'll evaluate it after I use it, but I haven't used it yet."
The tablet is relatively easy to use. I support domestic brands and give five-star praise as a reward.
The picture is clear and very good. My girlfriend likes it very much.
Poor delivery service attitude
Garbage delivery is slow.
"It seems that the most popular brands in the Beijing market are Mengniu Yili and Sanyuan, right?"
"It doesn’t look like a new phone when used, and the lag problem is huge"
"Not bad, I believe in Huawei’s quality. Great value for money."
There is something wrong with the screen.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Good performance
"The product is very good, very consistent with the original machine."
I haven't received the goods yet. No one informed me when you delivered them.
Not useful at all. Except for the battery. Special card. Everyone who plays King has joined the game. I still had to reconnect before I could get in.
I placed the order in the evening and received the goods the next morning. I have used it for two days and it feels good. The battery is also very durable. The free headphones and the protective film are very good. Like it!
"The screen is big, suitable for the elderly, it’s great"
I bought it on the first day and the price was reduced the next day. It’s such a scam. I’m really speechless.
"After booting and running, a blurry screen appeared; another very unpleasant shopping experience; very speechless. Jingdong’s quality is becoming less and less guaranteed. . . ."
very nice. The video is clear. It also runs fast. A pretty good shopping. Support JD.com
"As for the invoice, it’s different. It’s different. It’s different."
"I fell in love with it very early and waited for half a month before buying it on June 18, but the logistics was delayed by a day."
"Not satisfied, very dissatisfied, stuck, asking for cash back."
"The most unsatisfactory shopping experience was that I bought it the day before, but the price was reduced the next day, and I couldn't apply for price protection. It's more than a hundred dollars more expensive than other malls, which is really a scam."
"Bad review. No matter how high the configuration data is, it is still not smooth to use. It has eight cores and 3G remote storage. It is not even as good as the note3 I bought three years ago."
It’s so disgusting. I will never drink Mengniu again.
"Master, you are so funny. It’s still Mengniu Sour Yogurt, hahaha"
"It looks good on the outside, runs fast, and my kids said it works well, but I think it's a bit expensive. I don't know anything else about it."
"I have always believed in the quality of JD.com’s self-operated products. I think they are more reliable than physical stores and the logistics are faster! Brand new, great value! Hope you don’t disappoint us!"
Very useful. I gave it to my sister. She likes it very much~
It's very good. I bought it for my children as a learning tool. It's like a notebook. It's very convenient to carry in my bag. Just a small summer shoulder bag.
"The tablet is great and smooth! The sound quality in landscape mode is awesome! Just the right size to fit in my backpack. It's great to watch movies and stuff. Needless to say, the sound quality is great when listening to music!"
Too bad! Just a mobile phone and nothing!
"I have no choice but to give a bad review. The quality is good and there is nothing wrong with it, but I am so willful that I give you a bad review!"
"They were not allowed to unpack and inspect the product, there was no protective film attached, and there was no invoice. If there was a problem with the machine, I didn’t know who to contact, not to mention the low resolution."
The resolution is not very satisfactory. The desktop icons are all virtual and I feel very unhappy.
Very good very good very good
"Bought for a friend, he likes it very much."
"The mobile phone is okay, but the courier is not helpful. It's like just finding a random person to do the courier, unprofessional."
"I bought two for a clothing store, they should be pretty good."
"Just got it and used it briefly, it’s pretty good!"
"Not bad, the level of detail is not high. After all, the resolution is there. The system is quite smooth when I first used it, so it’s okay."
"I don’t know what it is like, but it should be good"
I am speechless about Jingdong. The prices change every day and I am quite happy! ! ! Make money by taking advantage of information asymmetries. What is the difference between this and cheating? There is no guarantee of price at all...
"The rubbish in the garbage, an electric heater cannot be charged, and it will run out of power in two hours. The logistics is ok, and the delivery speed is also ok, but the mobile phone is too bad. Don’t waste your time on something worth 1,000 yuan. I admit it."
"Needless to say, it’s very cost-effective and easy to use!"
"The system responds quickly and the screen is clear! The sound quality is great! Battery endurance is being tested! The 64Gsd card always prompts an error, but when I replace it with a 32G sd card, it no longer appears for some unknown reason!"
The system is very smooth and the colors are nice. Very useful.
"I have already used the Honor Tablet. It is very easy to use, especially the eye protection mode. It is very good and the price/performance ratio is relatively high. It is worth buying."
The mobile phone is not easy to use
"Bad review, this bad review is for JD.com."
There are no discounts at all on Double 12. Negative reviews...
"Very good, very good, very good, very good, very good"
"Everything is good, just a little small. I should buy a ten-inch one."
"Very good and quite satisfactory, but the film I bought by the way was folded and could not be applied. I was asked to call customer service for feedback, but they were too busy and didn't bother with it, which was quite disappointing!"
"What a scumbag! The WiFi signal is so crappy that I can't even watch video next to the router, and the signal is still full."
Just arrived and am currently trying it out. The initial use is good.
"Very good, logistics is fast"
"Unhappy shopping. There were gifts on the website when I bought them, but they didn't arrive when the goods arrived. It is said that there is a problem with refreshing my webpage. There are no gifts in my delivery area. How can I pay without getting stuck? I just want to send a gift card."
Screen display is blurry and has ghosting
"I'm almost freezing and stupid. I would like to make a Yili Qiaolezi or a box of Mengniu large fruit kernels and live happily in the big refrigerator in the classroom and dormitory. ""Come to the bowl quickly!"" ""Get out!"""
"When browsing Weibo updates, the layout pictures are displayed slowly, but clicking on them will display them very quickly."
"It's not good at taking pictures, and the system is so-so; it can only be used as an elderly phone, so don't buy this model if you have requirements."
Not easy to use. Occasionally gets stuck
"Dad likes it, it’s cheaper than the physical store."
Jingdong's delivery is very fast. I placed the order at night and received it the next day. . Huawei's quality is very good and the size is suitable. It is larger than a mobile phone and two times smaller than an ipod. It is also very affordable and worth buying. . .
Mengniu is poisoning the next generation
"I have used it to evaluate, and the response is very slow. The screen is not very clear"
"Bad review, the resolution is too bad, they don’t come with any screen paper, it’s very stuck, I even bought two at once, what a loss."
"Bad review, just forget about the low resolution, oh, I don’t want to say anything else, this is the worst purchase I’ve ever made"
"Not opened yet, but well packaged. This is my second time to buy, and I got a free gift, which is nice. Thanks"
Not bad. It took me a long time to evaluate it. I trust JD.com and love Huawei very much.
"Not satisfied at all, very bad"
"Very good, delivery speed is very fast, must praise it!"
"This is very easy to use, fast, clear and loud. It’s much easier to use than the old version of the iPad I have. Support domestic products! Unfortunately, the screen is still a bit small."
"The internet speed is very good, the quality is good, and the battery is also durable."
Very good. I tried it for a day before answering. I hope you won’t be disappointed in the future. The fluency is very good. I don’t know which one to choose or 64. I think it would be more convenient to put a phone card in it.
Jingdong’s online customer service is so inhumane
"Not shipped as standard, missing a protective film"
"Hello, thank you for your love for Mengniu products. I am Mengniu WeChat customer service, welcome to follow me."
Really easy to use! The family loves it! Good review! Happy shopping! Huawei deserves respect!
Huawei mobile phones are of good quality and very big
"Huawei's quality is good and it supports domestically produced tablets. You can also make calls, and JD.com's express delivery is extremely fast."
# Mengniu tamper with the production date# Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu.
"What about this 1.5L fresh milk? Mengniu is a little cheaper than Guangming Niu, so... drinking milk in winter is extremely exciting, especially from the time it is taken out of the refrigerator to the time it is gulped down. I have a Strong stomach."
"The screen of the mobile phone is large, comfortable to look at and easy to use. I am currently using it and will review it in a few days!"
"The phone is pretty good, but it doesn’t come with any gifts. I just bought it and the price was adjusted."
This product has low resolution and bad pixels. I forgot to look at it when I bought it! A little regretful!
Rubbish Huawei. The screen is so rubbish. It is extremely yellowish and makes the pictures unclear at all. It is troublesome to apply for a return.
"It feels really ordinary, the screen is very small, the operation buttons are also strange, and the new phone’s screen does not have a film. Only the back cover has a film, I won’t buy this again"
The machine works! The service attitude is super good and the logistics is super fast. There are just some scratches on the edge of the headphone jack. I don’t know if it is genuine. Everything else is normal. Thank you.
It took me a long time to review it. It’s really good. It’s authentic and much cheaper than the physical store.
Cherish life and stay away from Mengniu! Brother Long was almost poisoned to death. He is an unscrupulous businessman with a black heart! @ the leaves with unique skills
"I bought it for the elderly to watch TV series. The sound quality is very good, the battery is durable, and it can usually be watched for seven or eight hours. The screen is beautiful. Overall the quality is very good."
"I bought this for my wife. I don’t know how it works. Anyway, she said she likes everything I give it to her."
"The tablet runs very fast, and watching movies is very clear, especially the sound effects are very good."
"Very cost-effective, great for watching TV and playing games."
So angry
"It is relatively average, and it is difficult to watch videos for the elderly. It is recommended to increase the budget and buy a better one."
"Fortunately, it’s very affordable! Buy after you run out! ! Fortunately, it’s very affordable! Buy after you run out! !"
"Bad reviews, I won’t buy anything from JD.com in the future. I was so angry after buying it."
I bought it for my company. I took one out and tried it for a while. It feels good. It seems that the price has not been reduced. Please take a look at the pictures in detail.
"The price/performance ratio is still very high. The unit is used to conduct a survey. Anyway, it’s pretty good. Support domestic production."
It’s really great. It’s good to use.
"Can you believe that there is no sim card slot? Why do you dare to tell me no? It took me so long to just install the SIM card, but it turned out that there are such low-level mistakes."
Not bad~~~~~~~~
Not very satisfied with the quality. A bit stuck and running slowly
"Hai can handle low pixels, and others can still play games. I guess it’s a bit slow."
Get an instant discount of 200 when placing an order during Double Eleven! Purchase from 10.26-11.12 and enjoy a 20-day price guarantee!
"Currently in use, the real thing is better than the picture. The video speed is faster than that of mobile phones. It is an authentic Huawei tablet and is trustworthy."
Things are okay. Very upright
"The baby has been received. The quality is not clear. I will evaluate it after using it for a while, but the sound effect alone is not bad."
"I like pure milk, from Mengniu. In fact, when it comes to love, the simpler it is, the happier it is."
"The tablet has been used for more than a week without any lag, but it is very frustrating when charging. The charging head is very hot, and it is difficult to plug in the charging cable. It feels fluid... Come on, if it is correct, keep on working."
I bought a toy for my child. I tried it and it runs very fast and has high pixels.
Mengniu has always been a dishonest company. Mengniu will not dare to drink from it in the future.
"Good, cost-effective, great value for money, I will buy it next time"
"Satisfied, very good, excellent quality,"
"It’s good for watching TV and listening to music, and it’s also good for playing games."
"Jingdong sucks, I got ripped off the first time I bought something here."
"This phone has pretty good configuration, good system, smooth use, and cheap price."
"When I bought the phone, the data showed 4G. It only costs 2G when delivered. What a scam"
"You get what you pay for, the machine is a little delayed, but everything else is just average!"
"Finally I couldn't hold it back and bought it. I haven't used it much yet, but it's very good."
"# Mengniu Variety Big Show# I love Mengniu Youyi c very much\\^O^/ It has become a part of my life. I want to drink it when I am sad, and I want to drink it even more when I am happy. So, you know How to do it."
This is my second purchase. Huawei’s tablet is very good and the delivery is very fast. I like it.
"Mengniu high calcium milk, real fruit grains and Jindian every day. Life is so satisfying."
Very useful and affordable!
"Let’s talk about the product, the packaging is terrible. The resolution of the product is indeed not good, so it will be okay if it is used by the elderly. To be honest, it’s not as good as a thousand-yuan smartphone."
The stuff is very good. I bought it during the event. I trust JD.com’s self-operated stuff and its services.
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it, so angry!"
The screen of the pirated version got stuck after using it for less than a month. Don’t buy it.
The connection speed to wireless network is fast. There is a 4G network controllable switch. The sound effects for watching TV and movies with the upper and lower speakers are great. The display resolution is also very good compared to what Apple has.
Despise Mengniu! Never buy any Mengniu products again! ! ! ! Scum! Repost Weibo
"Bad review, less than 20 days after I bought it, it couldn’t be turned on last night, it couldn’t be charged, customer service didn’t care about anything, the screen wasn’t sensitive when playing, and the pixels were still poor."
It feels good. I'll give it a try after a while.
"It's very exquisite and easy to use. I originally planned to buy Xiaomi, but finally chose Huawei."
Mengniu stinky idiot
"The packaging is complete! The screen resolution is high, easy to use, and the size is just right!"
"I discovered that I like milk-based drinks. For example, Wangzai, Wahaha, Mengniu, Guoliniuyou. What's going on? Not grown up? Not really."
"Don’t believe it, everyone. It’s so rubbish. It broke within a month after you bought it. It’s so deceptive. It’s rubbish. It’s rubbish."
"Very good tablet, easy to use."
"Love you a lot, love you Mengniu. Happiness is about helping each other, happiness is about sharing, happiness is about going through adversity together~~ Happiness comes from every little thing in life."
"It’s okay, not bad, very good, for children to play with"
The product is as good as ever. This is already the third one. The logistics is also very fast.
"Bought this for my niece, she loves it and I am very happy too."
"64g, 8 inches, why not make it dual-SIM dual standby. The page introduction is also unclear."
"I’m complaining about a facial mask with big water droplets. I don’t know why it’s so popular, and it’s even muddled! What I recommend is the Beautiful Diary Cactus Hydrating Mask, which not only smells great but is also hydrating! The taste of Mengniu aloe vera yogurt, hahaha!"
"It’s not easy to use at all, the battery is not durable, and the card holder is rusty. Because it takes some time to return the phone, but I urgently need the phone, I have to take it to a mobile phone store."
"The screen is large and the running speed is fast, making it very convenient for online shopping. The price on JD.com is very favorable, and I am very satisfied with the choice of this mobile phone."
"The sound quality is good, and the effect of watching videos and movies is good. Now, although the Android tablet is not as good as Apple, it is getting closer. The price is much better than Apple's. Suitable for those who are on a budget and watch movies frequently. Very valuable"
"Back then, the funnel at Sanlu Farm was broken. I accidentally added too much melamine. The manager of Mengniu probably drank too much at Moutai the day before yesterday. I accidentally changed the date too much."
"The worst online purchase on JD.com. There was always a bright spot on the lower left edge of the tablet. I couldn’t fix it no matter what, and I didn’t have time to return it."
"After placing the order, the logistics was extremely slow. It took 13 or 14 days for the product to arrive, which made me feel very uncomfortable. As a result, the phone broke within two months of receiving it. Can't turn on the machine."
"The goods are good, and the delivery speed is also fast! The price/performance ratio is very good for this price!"
I bought it for 999 yuan and my family used it and thought it was very good.
"It's very smooth. After using it for a month, I feel that Huawei's products are all top-notch at home and abroad."
"Everything else is fine, except for 2G calls and Internet speed, which is too slow."
"If everything is normal, it will definitely be five points. In fact, after placing the order, it was out of stock. It took more than 10 days to receive it. I bought it for someone else and gave me the money first."
It’s really good. This amazing machine is worth it at this price. I like it.
"I bought it for my dad and used it to watch TV and read novels. I heard that Dad’s is pretty good and not expensive. Good reviews. When I got it, I used it myself and it felt very comfortable."
"There are Mengniu, Sanlu and Guangming Hospitality!"
Bought this for my mom. The screen is big and video chat is easy to use.
"The camera is easy to use and responds quickly, but the pixels are slightly poor, which is acceptable."
"Charging is also too slow. It only took two hours to charge 20% of the battery, and the picture clarity is not good either."
"Very easy to use, not bad, not bad"
"Bought for a friend, the feedback is not bad?"
"This is an additional comment. After using the phone for a few days, the black borders are too big. However, the signal, network, and speed are all satisfactory, and there is no heat. Overall, I'll give it five stars..."
"A good tablet, fingerprint unlocking is super fast! The screen ratio is suitable for watching movies and playing games."
"The Bluetooth is very poor and incompatible with the car. Even the terrible Tianyu doesn’t have this problem. After waiting for more than a month, the B013 update is still incompatible."
"It's a pity that the packaging is not very good, it feels like someone has opened it! Hope the phone is genuine."
"The color is a bit off, very dizzy. Not good for watching movies"
"So-so, the battery is not that good"
"I really can’t compliment the express delivery. It was promised to arrive on the 16th, but it was delayed until the afternoon of the 18th. It was also called Double Eleven. Your sister’s 16th is already 5 days away from Double Eleven."
My family has banned Mengniu for a long time. Mengniu yogurt was revealed to be produced on February 30. Mengniu responded: The product in the photo is not a Mengniu product. http:t.cn/zYQK973
"Some Chinese people who grew up drinking Mengniu are bitter, ugly and have mixed feelings."
"If you accidentally touch it, the screen will go black."
"Mengniu, come on! Recently I have found that there are fewer voices criticizing Mengniu and more voices supporting Mengniu. I hope you will never let your supporters down again in the future."
Things are good and very good
"The price was reduced as soon as I bought it, and you are not allowed to apply for price protection!"
"Hey, I don’t even dare to drink Yilimeng beef now. . ."
"I unkindly suspect that they have personal grudges (such as the so-called lack of cooperation). Otherwise, why is a company like Mengniu not changing and dying, and no one has spoken out?"
The price dropped by 50 just after I placed the order. Things on JD.com are becoming less and less cost-effective.
"Disadvantages: Frequent crashes and unresponsiveness, poor CPU and GPU, and high-end gaming cards. Advantages: High screen clarity and good sound effects. Among them, crashing is a big problem and it is almost unusable. The in-house processor is a flaw. no way."
Mengniu. I will never sell it again. I can't afford to be hurt by my cheating. Second Austrian. Let's talk about people's names. The name of a good personality is weird. Sister Mengniu will never drink it.
"Another purchase, bought on behalf of a friend, I am quite satisfied, the quality of Huawei is still good,~~~~"
"It's too bad. When I first got it, the SIM couldn't be pulled out as soon as I plugged it in. The user immediately failed the physical examination and asked for an exchange, which was pushed back and forth. The user experience is negative. You know the service of JD.com, it doesn’t respond for a long time."
"The screen clarity is not very good and the storage space is small, but you can add a TF card and I am still trying it out."
I've been using it for two days and there's no problem. I think it's OK.
"The screen is too blurry to watch TV clearly, and the response is slow after using it for a long time."
"The tablet is okay, but the GPS star collection is scumbag, scumbag scumbag, I bought it just for the GPS, does it take a whole night to collect stars? ? , I really want to return it, but unfortunately my son likes it."
Not bad. Very high definition. 2K is not an exaggeration. The sound quality is very good. It’s really good to watch videos in stereo.
The Harman Kardon sound effect is good and the screen size is suitable.
"I was very upset when the price was reduced after I bought it, and the price difference was not refunded. I was angry."
"When I brought it over, there were scratches on the screen, which made me unhappy immediately."
"The product is okay, but the worst thing is that the software can only be used on mobile phones, which is no different from a big mobile phone. The low score is mainly because JD.com’s logistics is too slow, and the order is not shipped until a week later!"
Jingdong is cheating. The product itself is good. The problem is that the first purchase is followed by a promotion the next day.
A mobile phone is a mobile phone. It's broken before you use it. Call customer service and they won't care.
The machine is very good and compact for internal use in the company. I like it.
"I was so unhappy with the purchase. The logistics was super slow. When it was delivered to my home, they actually helped me return it and then shipped it again. I was speechless."
"To be honest, I was quite satisfied when I first got it. After playing with it for a day, the problems started to disappear. The screen suddenly went black while watching a movie. I was really drunk. I only bought it two days ago and the resolution is indeed not high. The pictures and videos look like pirated discs."
"It is on the list, but not when receiving the goods."
"Not bad, I hope there will be more high-quality services in the future."
"Logistics is very fast, the order placed in the early morning has arrived now. I feel like the tablet is pretty good. I bought it at a discounted price. It’s very affordable, but the sound quality isn’t as good as the m3. Of course, you get what you pay for. Overall, it’s pretty good."
"Mengniu, you better go to hell! Tutu, my friend, he drank too much from Mengniu when he was little... Reply Do you believe this? Reply New Mengniu, new changes. http:t.cn/zWBhkvl"
good! Very satisfied! Thumbs up for this speed?
"Very bad. Although the service is good, the quality is very poor. I only saw it online and didn’t expect that I could buy it. I exchanged it twice and finally returned it."
"I bought it on November 23, 2016. By January 11, 2017, the phone could not receive or receive calls. The frequency only showed emergency calls. It was urgent and annoying. It was such a delay. This product is not good."
"One star, plenty of spare time, two data cables, no headphones, and said there are no headphones as standard."
This is very good and cost-effective
"The sound effect of Harman Kardon is not covered, and the display is clear. There was a small incident during the JD Express delivery process, and it was finally resolved satisfactorily!"
"Smaller than the palm of your hand, larger than a mobile phone, very light and easy to use"
The screen is very blurry. I don’t like it. This is my first negative review.
Bought this for my mother to play games. She loves it. I placed the order at 11pm and it arrived at 10am the next morning. Awesome.
"It’s okay to use, and children can use it for learning!"
"Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry up"
"Really good, love it"
"Received, not as good as expected. Logistics is okay. At first it was difficult to insert the card. I took it to the customer service center to fix it. It is better to buy it in the store."
"The water heater works very well, heats up quickly and looks good."
"Not bad, Mom uses it to play games every day"
It feels pretty good! It feels pretty good! It feels pretty good! It feels pretty good! It feels pretty good! It feels pretty good! It feels pretty good! It feels pretty good!
"Feels good, shipped quickly"
"Yes, yes, yes"
very nice
Tofu dregs. I turned it on and it didn't move for half a day. It's really rubbish. First time purchasing with a friend’s account. I will never shop on JD.com again
"Sorry, the card is too loose!"
"I bought it for my mother’s birthday, okay? I like it very much. I use it to play games every day and I don’t even need to wear glasses."
"Well, I reported it several times but it just won’t change. . . No wonder the coffee machine insists on using Mengniu. I don’t drink it even if I use the system. I never drink the Mengniu that is issued on the plane. I don’t go there either, even though they don’t want me either? Inner Mongolia. ."
Happiness is seeing Mengniu! Saw hope @ZHUOXUNXun
"The price/performance ratio is high and the processor is relatively fast. After all, it is a national brand. Support domestic products."
"When I bought it, it was 998, which is considered an affordable price. Sufficient for daily use"
Stay away from Mengniu! Mengniu is not good at all
I bought it for a colleague and said it was okay.
"It’s fast, has a big screen, and is good for watching TV. I mainly bought it for my dad to play chess."
I bought a Huawei mobile phone on May 31st. I have only used it for half a month. There is a problem with the mobile phone. The response is slow and the screen of the mobile phone has a red light. Poor mobile phone quality
This mother only used it for a few days and she said it was stuck. It’s so incompetent.
"Don't buy it, it pisses me off... The speaker I bought on 2015-07-03 has broken on the 29th. Who am I looking for first? (Truthfully, truthfully, truthfully)"
"Beautiful appearance, easy to operate, fast, Huawei’s quality is good"
"The resolution is too low. Not to mention watching movies, I couldn't watch them at all. Even the software inside seemed unclear and hazy. Finally, after careful consideration, I returned it."
Mengniu has changed its packaging. It’s so depressing and ugly.
"Mengniu has new packaging, it’s quite fresh"
Does it matter whether it's true or not? Mengniu has long been a street rat.
The things my friend bought using the account number... it should be OK... I didn't hear him say anything bad... it should be OK... I don't know the specifics...
"It's okay to use, but there are no headphones and the data cable is gone. It's too fake."
"On a rainy and snowy weekend, while cooking and listening to music lectures by famous teachers, Mengniu said, enjoy this little happiness."
